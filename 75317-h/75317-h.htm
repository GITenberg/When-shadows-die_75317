  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER I<br> <span class='c005'>MEETING AND PARTING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Earl of Enderby and his sister, Mrs. Force, acting
under the directions of the earl’s doctor, now set
out for Germany, and in due time reached Baden-Baden.
Their apartments, which had been secured by telegram,
were ready for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had one night’s rest from the journey, and were
waiting for their breakfast to be served in their private
parlor, when they were surprised by the entrance of Mr.
Force and all his party.</p>

<p class='c007'>The family had been separated scarcely three months,
yet to see them meet a spectator might think they had
been parted for three years.</p>

<p class='c007'>They soon paired off.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force and his wife sat down together on a corner
sofa and began to exchange confidences.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leonidas and Odalite stood together at the window of
the room, looking out upon the busy scene on the street,
or rather seeming to do so, for they were really talking
earnestly together on the subject of their troubled present
and uncertain future.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had not been separated for one day during their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>travels; but they were to say good-by to each other very
soon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It might be for years, and it might be forever.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And so they seized every opportunity for a <em>tête-à-tête</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wynnette and Elva hovered around their mother, in
their delight at seeing her again.</p>

<p class='c007'>The invalid earl sat for a while alone and forgotten,
until little Rosemary Hedge, who was also overlooked in
the family reunion, drew a hassock to the side of his
easy chair, sat down and laid her little, curly black head
on his knee. The action was full of pathos and confiding
tenderness. The earl laid his hand on the little head and
ran his thin, white fingers through the black curls. But
neither spoke, or needed to speak—so well the man and
the child understood each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Leonidas, my boy!” called Abel Force from his corner,
“I wish you would go and see if we can get rooms
for us all here. This should have been seen to sooner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You need not stir, young sir,” said the earl; and
turning to his brother-in-law, he added: “Your apartments
are secured, Force. As soon as I received your
telegram saying that you would join me here, I sent off a
dispatch to secure them for you. I hardly need to remind
you that you are all my guests while we are together.
But you traveled by the night express. You
must have done so to reach this place so early in the day;
so you will want to go to your rooms. After you have
refreshed yourselves, join me here at breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Le arose at the earl’s request, and pulled at the bell
knob with a vigor lent by his impatience at being called
from the side of his beloved, and which soon brought a
servant to the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Show these ladies and gentlemen to the apartments
prepared for them,” said the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>The man, with many bows, preceded the party from
the room and conducted them to a large family suit of
rooms on the third floor, overlooking the New Promenade.</p>

<p class='c007'>The travelers remained some weeks at Baden-Baden.
The baths were doing the earl much good. Mr. Force
also needed their healing powers. Somewhere on his
travels with the young people, not having his wife to
look after him, he had contracted rheumatism; he could
not exactly tell when or where or how, whether from
exposure or rain and mist on the mountains, or from
fishing on the lakes, or from sleeping in damp sheets,
and drinking the sour wine of the country, or from all
these causes put together, he could not say, so gradually
and insidiously had the malady crept upon him, taking
its chronic and least curable form. He had not mentioned
one word of this in any of his letters, nor had he
spoken of it on his arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed,” as he afterward explained, “never having
had any experience to guide me, I did not recognize the
malady at first, but merely took the feeling of heaviness
in all my frame for over-fatigue, and even when that
heaviness, being increased, became a general aching, I
still thought it to be the effect of excessive fatigue. I
was slow to learn and slower to confess that I had the
special malady of age—rheumatism. However, I thank
Heaven it is not acute. It has never laid me up for a
day,” he added, laughing at his misfortune.</p>

<p class='c007'>Indeed, his troubles seldom kept him from making up
parties for excursions to the various objects of interest
in the town and its environs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only when the days were both cold and wet, as is
sometimes, not often, the case in early autumn there,
did Abel Force allow his young folks to go forth alone
under the care of their mother and the escort of Leonidas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>while he stayed within doors and played chess with
the invalid earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this way the brothers-in-law became better acquainted
and more attached.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish you were an Englishman, Force,” said the
earl one day, when he had just checkmated Abel and was
resting on his laurels.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not because I do not admire and respect your nationality,
but simply for one reason.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will tell you. You know, of course, that your wife
is my heiress, and if she survives me, will be my successor.
Now, if you were an Englishman you might get
the reversion of your wife’s title.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not want it. I would not ask for it, nor even
accept it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is your republican pride. Perhaps you are
right. The old earldom has fallen to the distaff at
length, and it will be likely to stay there for some generations
to come; for Elfrida, who will be a countess in
her own right, has only daughters, which is a pity. And
yet I don’t know—I don’t know. If those fellows at
Exeter Hall, and elsewhere, get their way, in another
century from this there will not be an emperor or a
king, to say nothing of a little earl, to be found above
ground on the surface of this fourth planet of the solar
system commonly called the earth, and their bones will
be as great a curiosity as those of the behemoth or the
megatherium. Shall we have another game?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And they played another, and yet another, game, in
perfect silence, interrupted only by the monosyllable
ejaculations of technicalities connected with their play.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl arose the winner; he often—not always—did.
And so he was in high spirits to welcome the return
of the excursionists to dinner.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Another sad day of separation was drawing near. Le
was to leave them on the eleventh of October, giving
himself twenty days in which to travel from Baden-Baden,
in Germany, to Washington, in the United
States.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was according to his uncle’s advice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You might stay here until the fifteenth, or even
until the seventeenth, and then reach Washington by the
thirty-first; but it would, under the most favorable circumstances,
be so close a shave as to be perilous to risk.
An officer, nay, a man, may risk anything else in the
world, Le, but he must not risk his honor. You must
report for duty at headquarters punctually on the first
of November, at any cost of pain to yourself or to
others.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it, uncle—I know it, and I will do my duty.
Never doubt me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never do, my boy. And listen, Le. If you are
prompt, as you are sure to be, you may be able to obtain
orders for the Mediterranean, and then, Le, we shall see
you again on this side. We will go to any port where
your ship may be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, uncle. I shall try for orders to the Mediterranean.
And I think I shall get them. You see, I
have been to the west coast of Africa, and I have been
to the Pacific Coast, and I really think I may be favored
now with orders to the Mediterranean. However, an
officer must do his duty and obey, wherever he may be
sent—if it were to Behring’s Straits!” concluded Le,
with a dreary attempt at laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the day of parting drew very near, and the depressed
spirits of the lovers were evident to all who observed
them, Mr. Force suddenly proposed that he and
his Odalite should accompany Le to the steamer and see
him off.</p>

<p class='c007'>This proposition was received by the two young people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>with grateful joy, as a short but most welcome reprieve
from speedy death, or—what seemed the same thing to
them—speedy separation. It gave them two or three
more days of precious life, or its equivalent—each other’s
society.</p>

<p class='c007'>They cheered up under it and looked more hopefully
to the future. And in a few weeks more, they decided,
they should be sure to see Le again at some of the ports
of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the day of parting came, Mr. Force, Leonidas
and Odalite took leave of the earl and the ladies of
their party and left Baden-Baden for Ostend.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were not so many steamship lines or such facilities
for rapid transit as in these days.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our three travelers went by rail to Ostend, thence by
steamer to London, where they rested for one night, and
thence by rail to Liverpool, which they reached just
twelve hours before the sailing of the <em>Africa</em> for New
York.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force and Odalite took leave of Le on the deck of
the steamer, and left it only among the very last that
crossed the gang plank to the steam tender a moment
before the farewell gun was fired and the <em>Africa</em> steamed
out to sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>A crowd of people stood on the deck of the steamer,
waving last farewells to another crowd on the deck of
the tender, who waved back in response, and gazed until
all distinct forms faded away in the distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among those on the tender who stood and gazed and
waved the longest were Mr. Force and Odalite, who saw,
or thought they saw, Le’s figure long after everybody
else had given up the attempt to distinguish their own
departing friends in a mingled and fading view.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER II<br> <span class='c005'>STARTLING NEWS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When the tender reached the dock Mr. Force touched
his daughter’s arm, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We can get a train back to London, and catch the
night steamer to Ostend, and be with your mother by to-morrow
evening. Shall we do so, or shall we go down to
Chester and take a little tour through the Welsh mountains?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no; papa, dear. We will go home to mamma, if
you please,” said Odalite, who, amid all her grief, noticed
the pale and worn look on the patient face that
told of his silent suffering.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, my dear. I only thought it would divert
you,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>They drove from the docks to the Adelphi, where Mr.
Force paid their hotel bill, took up the little luggage,
and, with his daughter, drove on to the railway station,
and caught the express train to London, a tidal train that
connected with the Ostend night boat.</p>

<p class='c007'>They reached Ostend the next day, and before night
arrived at Baden-Baden, where they were received with
gladness by their family, who did all that was possible
to cheer the spirits of Odalite and raise her hopes for
the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>They all remained in Germany until the first of November,
and then set out to spend the winter on the
banks of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their first halting place was Genoa, where they waited
letters from Le.</p>

<p class='c007'>The letters arrived at length, bringing good news. Le
was assigned to the man-of-war <em>Eagle</em>, bound for the
Mediterranean! Bound direct for Genoa!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Then, in perfect content, they settled down for the
winter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl’s health was certainly improving in the mild
air of sunny Italy, and his spirits were rallying in the
society of his relatives, so he also decided to remain in
Genoa.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the end of November the <em>Eagle</em> was in port,
and Midshipman Force hastened to see his friends at
their house on the Strada Balbi.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had been absent only seven weeks, yet they received
him with as much joy as though they had not
seen him for seven years.</p>

<p class='c007'>As long as his ship lay at anchor in the harbor his
friends remained in the Strada Balbi. And whenever
he could get a day or a half day off he came to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the <em>Eagle</em> sailed for Nice the family left Genoa
for the same city, and took up their quarters at the Hotel
de la Paix, and the same pleasant intercourse was resumed.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so the winter passed. And Mr. Force was beginning
to contemplate the possibility of having his daughter
freed from a merely nominal and most unfortunate
marriage. To do this it would be necessary, according
to his ideas of honor, that they should return to the state
and the parish where the marriage ceremony had been
nearly performed, but was finally interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was no hurry, he thought. Le was on the
Mediterranean, and his duty would keep him there for
two or three years longer.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was another source of occasional uneasiness—the
political condition of the United States. Ever since
the presidential election, in November, dissatisfaction
had spread in certain sections of the country, and trouble
seemed to be brewing.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this, coming through the newspapers to the knowledge
of the absentees, gave them disturbance, but really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>not much, so thoroughly confident were they all in the
safety of the Union, and the grand destiny of the republic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The clouds on the political horizon would vanish, and
all would be well. No harm could come to the country,
which was the Lord’s City of Refuge for the oppressed
of all the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had heard not a word from or of Angus Anglesea
since the Washington detective had traced him to
Canada, and there lost him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Le privately and most earnestly hoped that the villain
had got himself sent to some State prison for life, or,
well, hanged—which the midshipman thought would
have been even better. At least, however, the family
he had wronged so deeply seemed now to be well rid of
him. But Le expressed a strong wish that his uncle
would return to Maryland in the spring and have Odalite
entirely freed by the law from the bond, or rather, the
shadow of the bond, that lay so heavily on her life, and
on his.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No doubt I could easily have Odalite set free from
her nominal marriage with a villain, who was forced to
leave her at the altar before the benediction had been
given. But to do this, Le, I should have to take her
home to Maryland, where you could not follow her for
two or three years. So, what good could come of hurry?
Besides, we are no longer molested by the villain Anglesea.
Be thankful for that blessing, Le, and for the rest
be patient.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Patient!’” exclaimed the youth. “You have so
often told me to be patient, and I have so long been patient,
that I am unutterably impatient of the very word
‘patient’!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon, Le. I will not persecute you
with the word any longer,” gravely replied the elder
man.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“Uncle, I beg your pardon! I do, indeed. I feel myself
to be an ungrateful and most unreasonable wretch!
Here you have made my burden as light as you can by
showing me all sorts of favors and giving me all sorts of
privileges, moving about from place to place to give me
opportunity of being with you all, and here am I like a
beast losing my temper with you. Uncle! I don’t deserve
that you should pardon me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say no more, Le! Dear boy, I can understand your
trials; but look on the brighter side, my lad. The best of
the business now is that Anglesea does not trouble us.
He seems to have died out of our lives.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but has he, uncle? He did that once before for
three years, and even advertised himself as dead and
buried. But he suddenly came to life again, and sprang
into our midst like a very demon, to do us all the harm
that he possibly could. How do we know when he will
reappear to disturb us? Uncle! I do not mean to
threaten, because I do not wish to sin; but I foresee that,
if Anglesea ever comes in my way again, the sight of
the man will goad me to crime.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, Le! No, my dear boy! Do not talk so! If
ever you should be tempted, pray to the Lord. And
think of Odalite. To bring yourself to evil would break
her heart, Le!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will pray that I may never set eyes on that man
again, uncle!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after this conversation, near the last of February,
the family went to Rome to witness the grand
grotesque pageantry of the carnival. Le could not leave
his ship to go with them, and so they only remained during
the week of orgies, and as soon as it was over returned
to Naples, where the <em>Eagle</em> was then at anchor.
Here they settled themselves in furnished lodgings, on
the Strada di Toledo, for the spring months.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was early in May.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>They were all—with the exception of Le, who was on
duty on his ship—assembled in a handsome front room
overlooking the Strada.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl, whose health was so much improved that his
friends hoped for its full restoration, sat in his easy chair
beside a little stand, playing a game of chess with Wynnette,
who had developed into a champion chess player,
and was much harder to beat than ever her father had
been.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force, who, suffering from a return of his malady,
lay on a sofa, pale and patient, but in too much pain to
read or to talk. Odalite sat near him, silently working
on the silk flower embroidery she had learned to like
from her mother’s example.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elva and Rosemary, at a round table, were turning
over a set of “views” left by Le on his previous visit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Force was opening a newspaper received that
morning, and smoothing it out, preparatory to reading it
aloud to her family.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly she dropped the paper, covered her face with
her hands, and fell back in her chair, wailing forth the
words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my Lord! my Lord! This is the very hardest
thing to bear of all that went before!”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The first gun of our Civil War was fired, and its
report was heard throughout the civilized world!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Abel! Oh, Abel!” moaned Mrs. Force, still
pale with emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it, my dear? Calm yourself! All that you
hold nearest and dearest are in this room with you.
What trouble can come upon you?” inquired her husband,
rising from his couch of pain and limping toward
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She lifted the newspaper from the floor and handed
it to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Enderby looked from one to the other in perplexity.
He did not like to ask a question—he waited to hear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Odalite, Wynnette and Elva also waited in anxious
suspense for their father to explain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not so Rosemary. Her agony of anxiety burst forth
at length in a cry:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Mr. Force! is my mother dead, or what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No one is dead, my child. And no special evil has
come to you,” said Abel Force. Then speaking to his
expectant friends, he said: “There is a civil war at
home.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>His explanation was like a bombshell dropped in their
midst. All shrank away aghast and in silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before any one recovered speech the door was thrown
open, and Le burst in the room in great excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have heard the news!” he cried; and that was
his only greeting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, we have heard the news,” gravely replied Mr.
Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have come to bid you good-by. The mail that
brought the news brought dispatches from the navy department
ordering our ship home. We sail with the
next tide; that will be in an hour. Good-by! good-by!”
he said, beside himself with mingled emotions, as he hurried
from one to another, taking each in his arms for a
last embrace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Le—this is awfully sudden!” exclaimed Mr.
Force, as he wrung the young midshipman’s hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes! yes! awfully sudden! Odalite! Oh, Odalite!”
he cried, turning to his eldest cousin and once betrothed
last of all, as if he had reserved his very last embrace
and kiss for his best beloved—“oh, my Odalite! May
God love, and bless, and guard you. Good-by! Good-by!
my dearest dear!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Le pressed her to his heart, and turned and
dashed out of the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Le! But, Le! Wait! Can we not go to the
ship and see you off?” cried Wynnette, hurrying after
him, and overtaking him at the street door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! no! Impossible, my dear! A boat is waiting
to take me to the ship! I have barely time to reach her
deck before she sails! There would be no time for last
adieus there! God bless you! Take care of Odalite!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The street door banged behind Le, and he was gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wynnette had flown downstairs, but she crawled up
again, dragging weary steps, “woe befreighted,” behind
her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>She entered the room, and sat down in silent sympathy
beside Odalite, who lay back in her chair, too stunned
by the shock of all that had happened to weep or to
moan, or even to realize the situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Force went and sat on the other side of her
stricken daughter, took her hand, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, nothing but prayer can help you now. You
must pray, Odalite.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl pressed her mother’s hand, but made no
reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force and Lord Enderby were in close conversation
on the political conflict out of which the war had
arisen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elva and Rosemary were standing together in the
oriel window overlooking the street, too much startled
by the suddenness of events to feel like talking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us hope that this trouble will soon be over,” said
the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! be put down like one of your corn riots, by
the simple reading of the ‘act’?” inquired Abel Force,
grimly. “No, Enderby! I know my countrymen, North
and South. And the civilized world will see a war that
has never been paralleled in the history of nations.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And his words proved prophetic.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this day every mail from America was looked
for in the keenest anxiety; and every mail brought the
most startling and exciting news. Every schoolboy and
schoolgirl is now familiar with the leading events of the
war, and they need not be rehearsed here.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among news of more general interest came some of a
private nature to the Forces.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the rest, letters from Mrs. Anglesea, who
wrote:</p>

<p class='c008'>“You had better pack right up and come right home.
‘The devil is to pay, and no pitch hot!’ The people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>have riz up ag’in’ one another like mad. Ned Grandiere
has gone into the Confederate Army. Sam sticks at
home. He says war is bad for the crops, and somebody
must plow and sow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“William Elk has gone into the Union Army.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks be to goodness, Old Beever and Old Barnes
and Old Copp are all past sixty, and too old to fight, or
they’d turn fools with the rest; but, as it is, they’re
’bliged to stay home and ’tend to their business, and
take care of Mondreer and Greenbushes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But they do say, hereabouts, as old Capt. Grandiere—and
he over seventy years old—has turned pirate, or
privateer, or something of the sort, and is making war
on all Uncle Sam’s ships; but I can’t believe it for one.
And young Roland Bayard is with him—first mate—and
is as deep in the mud as the captain is in the mire,
and is tarred with the same brush—which I mean to
say as they are both a pirating on the high seas, or a privateering,
or whatever their deviltry is, together. So
they say hereabouts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anyway, the ship is overdue for months, and neither
ship, officers nor crew has been heard of with any sort
of certain sureness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what I said in the beginning, old ‘oman, I say
in the end—as you and the ole man had better pack
right up and come right home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But still, if it would ill convenience you at the present
time to do so, you needn’t come, nor likewise fret
about your home. To be sure, the devil is let loose all
over the country, but he hasn’t entered into Mondreer or
Greenbushes yet. Me and the three old men, Copp, and
Beever, and Barnes, and the old niggers, take the very
best of care of everything. You bet your pile on that.
So do just as you think proper.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This letter filled the Forces with dismay, as it told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>them that their old friends and neighbors had risen, so
to speak, in arms against each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the most disturbing part of the news was that
which referred to old Capt. Grandiere and his mate,
young Roland Bayard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force, from his boyhood up to middle age, and
Mrs. Force, from her first arrival in Maryland to the
present time, had known the old mariner intimately and
respected him highly. They knew him, even in his
seventieth year, to be strong, vigorous, fiery and energetic.
But with all their knowledge of him they could
not know, in his absence, how he would regard the Civil
War, or which side he would take, if any, in the struggle.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had known young Roland Bayard from his infancy,
and known him to be pure, true, brave and heroic
as his namesake, but they could not judge, without him,
which side he would take in the conflict. Nor could they
reconcile it with their knowledge of these men that they
should run up the black flag, and wage a war after a
manner little better, if any better, than piracy.</p>

<p class='c007'>But of one course they were clear; namely, that they
must keep this baleful report as to Capt. Grandiere and
Mate Bayard from the hearing of little Rosemary Hedge.
The child must not be made miserable by a mere rumor
which might have no foundation in fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Force was even more affected than her husband
by the doubt that hung over the fate of the <em>Kitty</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>She answered her housekeeper’s letter, disclaiming all
belief in the story that Capt. Grandiere and Mate Bayard
had turned the <em>Kitty</em> and her crew into pirates.</p>

<p class='c007'>And for the rest, told her that they—the Force family—should
not return home for some months to come,
even if then.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later on there came a letter from Miss Susanna Grandiere
respecting her niece.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Miss Grandiere wrote in rather a stilted style, after
the manner of her old-fashioned romances. She wrote:</p>

<p class='c008'>“All through the beautiful summer, all through the
glorious autumn, all through the desolate winter of the
past twelve months we have been anticipating the exquisite
happiness of beholding you again in the blooming
spring, when nature rises from the grave, and arrays
herself in fresh and radiant apparel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, alas! evil days have fallen upon us. War stalks
abroad over our beloved country, spreading ruin, misery
and desolation. Brother rises up against brother, and
father against son. Friends and neighbors whose hearts
and minds were once united in the closest and holiest
bonds of friendship and affection, are now severed and
estranged in mutual hatred and malignity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In this spread of affliction and calamity a rumor
reaches us to the effect that the condition of your husband’s
constitution will detain you in foreign countries
for a considerable time to come.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If this report be truthful, and you should contemplate
a further sojourn in the Eastern hemisphere, I must
implore you still to retain my beloved niece under your
protection until you can procure some responsible escort
to convey her across the ocean to the home of her childhood.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should not venture to take the liberty of preferring
this request did I not accord the most perfect credence
to your protestations of attachment to our beloved child,
and of enjoyment in her society, and of the invaluable
benefit she herself derives from foreign travel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This, and much more to the same purpose and in the
same style, wrote Miss Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Force showed this letter to Rosemary, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>had a talk with her, and found that the child was quite
willing to do whatever her friends should think best.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Mrs. Force answered the letter, condoling with
Miss Grandiere on the state of the country, but also expressing
the pleasure she and all her family would feel
in keeping little Rosemary with them as long as the child
might be permitted to stay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still later on letters were received from Le. His ship
was at Charleston, forming one of the blockading fleet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Late in the summer of that year the Forces went again
to the hot baths of Baden-Baden for the benefit of the
husband and father’s health, which was giving the whole
family much concern.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='c005'>ROSEMARY IS STARTLED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Strange to say, that while Abel Force seemed in danger
of becoming a confirmed invalid, the condition of his
delicate brother-in-law improved every day.</p>

<p class='c007'>He no longer required the arm of his valet to lean on,
or even the help of a cane to walk with.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day his sister said to him:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Francis, I do believe that you have been more of a
hypochondriac than of a real invalid, after all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Elf,” he answered, “I am inclined to suspect that you
are right. Certainly most of my ailments, real or imaginary,
have vanished under the influence of change, motion
and society.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the earl continued to improve in health and
strength, his sister watched him with a new interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>On another day she said to him:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Francis, why don’t you marry?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Enderby started, and then he laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“What has put that into your head?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My anxious interest in your future—now that you
have a future, brother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you, who are my heir presumptive, wish me
to marry?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed, I would! You would be so much better and
happier! Think of it, Francis!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dearest, I am both too old and too young to fall
in love!” laughed the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What rubbish! ‘Too old and too young!’ What do
you mean by such absurdity?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have passed my first youth of sentiment, and I
have not yet reached my second childhood of senility!
Therefore, I am both too old and too young to fall in
love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense! That is not true; and, even if it were,
you are neither too young nor too old to marry. It is
not necessary that you should ‘fall in love.’ You might
meet some lady, however, whom you could love, and esteem,
and marry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where should I be likely to find such a lady? My
dear, I have never gone into society at all. Since my
return from India I have led a secluded life, on account
of my health.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On account of your hypochondria, you mean! Now,
Francis, you must change all that. In the beginning of
the next London season you must open your house on
Westbourne Terrace, and entertain company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you do the honors, Elfrida?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course I will,” replied the lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you can bring out your two daughters, and present
them at court.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I might do that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Had the earl felt disposed to look about him for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>wife, he might have found a suitable one in Baden-Baden.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were many of the English nobility and gentry
staying there for the benefit of the baths. Many very
attractive young ladies of rank were in the matrimonial
market. But, to tell the truth, the invalid earl, either
from real ill health or from hypochondria, was very shy
of strangers, and better liked to stroll, or ride, or drive
with “the children,” as he called his nieces and their
young friend, than to linger in the parlors of the hotel
or the pavilions of the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>In their rambles Odalite seldom joined them. She
preferred to stay with her suffering father, and share the
labors of her mother in the sick room. The earl and
the three younger girls usually set out together.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wynnette and Elva walking on before; the earl, with
little Rosemary’s hand clasped in his own, followed behind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ever since that day, now more than a year ago, when
the reunited members of the Force family met at Baden-Baden,
and paired off—Mr. and Mrs. Force on one
sofa, Odalite and Le on another, and Wynnette and Elva
on the window seat, leaving the earl, as it were, “out in
the cold,” and quite forgotten, and little Rosemary, also
temporarily forgotten, had drawn a hassock to the side
of his easy chair and sat down and laid her little curly
black head on his knee, in silent sympathy—ever since
that day the earl and the child had been fast friends. In
her tender little heart she pitied him for his weakness
and illness, just as she might have pitied any poor man
in any rank of life, and she had fallen into a habit of
silent sympathy with him, and of drawing her hassock to
the side of his chair, when they were all indoors, and of
taking his hand when they were out walking. Even
now, when the invalid had recovered health, strength
and spirits, these habits of the child, once formed, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>not easily to be broken. She no longer pitied him, because
she saw that he was no longer an object of pity;
but she drew her hassock to his side indoors, and took
his hand and walked with him outside. She seemed to
think that he belonged to her, or she to him, or they to
each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day they were sauntering slowly through the
grounds of the Conversation-Haus. Wynnette and Elva
were flitting on before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rosemary’s hand was—not on the earl’s arm—but in
his hand. He was so very much taller than the girl that
he led her like a child.</p>

<p class='c007'>There had been a pause in their talk, when the earl
gently closed his fingers over hers, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My little one, I love you very much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I hope you do, and it is so kind of you!” warmly
answered the child, returning the pressure of his hand
and acting toward him as she would have acted toward
her uncle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, you do care for me a little?” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, indeed, I care for you a great deal. I am
very fond of you,” said Rosemary, warmly, squeezing
his fingers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How old are you, Rosemary?” he gravely inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall soon be seventeen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed!” he exclaimed, turning and looking down on
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, indeed!” she answered, positively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you are such a quaint, little old lady, that I am
not surprised, after all. You might have been fifteen, or
you might have been twenty. But seventeen! That is a
sweet age—the age at which the Princess Royal of England
was married!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed!” exclaimed Rosemary, in her turn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, indeed!” he replied, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>And then there was silence between the two for a
few minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl was meditating. The child was uneasy, and
wondering why she was so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Little friend,” he said, at last, “you and I seem very
good friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, we are! And it is so very good of you to be
friends with me!” she answered, warmly, squeezing his
fingers in her small hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And we are really fond of each other.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, very, very fond of one another, and it is so kind
of you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why should you say it is kind of me, little sweet
herb?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, why, because you are so old and so grand; and
I am so little every way!” she said, with another squeeze
of his fingers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl winced; but whether at her words or her action,
who could say?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Am I so old, so very old, then, Rosemary?” he
gravely inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, no; I did not mean that! Of course, I
didn’t mean that you are as old as Mr. Force, who is
forty-five; but I meant—I meant—I meant—you are so
very much grown up, to be so kind as to walk and talk
with a girl like me as much as you do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, my dear, do you not like to have me walk and
talk with you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes! indeed, indeed I do! Oh, you know I do!”
she answered, fervently.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the earl was silent for a few moments, and then,
drawing her small hand into the bend of his arm, he
asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rosemary, would you like that you and I should
walk and talk together every day for the rest of our
lives?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>She turned and looked up into his face, as if she
wished to read his meaning.</p>

<p class='c007'>He smiled into her upraised eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you in earnest?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perfectly, Rosemary. Do you think I would jest
with you on such a subject?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! but I thought you knew me so well that you
would know without asking that I would love dearly to
walk and talk with you every day all our lives long, if
we could! But how could we? Some of these days I
shall go back to Maryland, and then we shall part and
never meet again! Oh! I hate to think that we shall
never meet again. You do seem so near to me! So
very near to me! As if you were my own, my very
own! Oh, sir! I beg your pardon! that was very presumptuous!
I ought to have said—I ought to have
said——” She stopped and reddened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, my child? You have said nothing wrong or
untrue. What do you think you ought to have said?”
the earl inquired, in a caressing tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I should have said, that I feel so near to you—that
I feel as if I were your own, your very own! It
was too, too arrogant in me to say that I feel as you belonged
to me. I should have said, as if I belonged to
you,” she explained. And then she laughed a little,
as in ridicule of her own little ridiculous self.</p>

<p class='c007'>His hand tightened on hers as he replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose we compromise the question and say that we
belong to each other?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that is it! And you are so good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you really wish that we two should walk and
talk together every day for the rest of our lives?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes; if it could be so!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rosemary,” he said, very gravely, as he still held and
pressed her hand, “there is but one way in which it could
be so.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>He paused, and she looked up.</p>

<p class='c007'>How long he paused before he could venture to startle
the child by his next words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“By marriage. Rosemary, dear, will you marry me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She turned pale, but did not withdraw her astonished
eyes from his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you say, little friend?” inquired the suitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, oh, oh!” was what she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does that mean yes or no, Rosemary?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do not like me well enough to marry me, then,
Rosemary?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, I do! Indeed, indeed I do; I would marry
you in a minute, but—but—but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am engaged!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER V<br> <span class='c005'>THE EARL IS STARTLED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>He held her off to get a better view of her face. Then
he stared at her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You! Engaged?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>She nodded two or three times in reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Such a mite as you! Why, how long have you been
engaged, pray?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—don’t quite know. Ever since I can remember.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! a family arrangement between your parents and
your betrothed husband’s, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no; not at all! Only between him and me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At that early age! Do babies betroth themselves in
America?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t quite know; but we did! And we were not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>both babies. He was a schoolboy, but I think I was a
baby at first.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At first, very likely! Well, when are you to be married?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t quite know. But not until Roland gets his
rights and comes into his estates.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! there is litigation? But who is this happy man
Roland?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is a mate on a merchantman at present. But
when he gets his rights, I am sure he will be a nobleman
of high rank, and maybe a prince of royal race.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh!” said the earl, with a curious smile. Then,
growing suddenly very grave, he inquired:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear child, do your parents know anything about
your relations with this—adventurer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is not an adventurer,” said Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But when he, a skipper’s mate, represents himself to
be a man of rank, kept out of his rights——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he don’t represent himself to be any other than
what he seems!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I beg your pardon, my dear! I thought you
said he did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; oh, no! I said that I feel sure that when he gets
his rights, he will be a nobleman or a prince!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! but why should you think so, my dear!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! no one could look at Roland Bayard and not
know him to be one of princely rank!” exclaimed Rosemary,
with such solemn fervor that the earl turned and
gazed at her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And is this the only reason you have for thinking
the young man of gentle blood?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! not only his looks, but his voice, speech, tone,
manner, gesture—all proclaim him of noble blood!”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Rosemary spoke, she suddenly turned and looked
intently at the earl, and then she added:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“Yes! It is true! It is not imagination! I have
thought of it often, though I never spoke of it before!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of what, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of Roland Bayard’s likeness to you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To me, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, to you! But for the difference in age and in
health, he is as much like you as one man can be to another!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An imaginary or an accidental likeness, my child.
But, Rosemary, to return to yourself. Do your parents,
or guardians, know anything of your relations with this
questionable stranger?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is not a questionable stranger. He was brought
up among us at home. Did I not tell you he used to ride
me on his shoulder when he was a boy and I was a
baby?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, if he is not a stranger, you must know all
about him, and whether he is of high or low degree.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We do know all about him, but nothing at all about
his family. He was saved from a ship that was wrecked
on our coast, and he was the only one saved, and there
was not a mark on him or his clothing to identify him.
Mr. Force undertook to provide for him, and placed him
with Miss Sybilla Margaretta Bayard, who was herself
descended from a great English duke, though no one
would ever think so to look at her! Mr. Force also sent
Roland to school and afterward to college, and he would
have sent him to the Naval Academy, at Annapolis, only
he had already used all his influence to get Leonidas entered
there, and he could not ask the same favor for
Roland. So Roland, being bent upon going to sea, entered
the merchant service.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! I see. But, my child, it seems to me that you
have not yet answered the question that I have twice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>put to you: Do your parents, or guardians, know of the
engagement between you and this young man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have only one parent—my mother. My father was
lost at sea, before I was born, and left no property and
no will, because his ship went down, with everything
on board. My mother has some property, and so has
Aunt Sukey, and they take care of me,” said Rosemary;
and that was all she said at the time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl looked at her curiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Was the child purposely evading his question?</p>

<p class='c007'>No; the grave little face was too true for that thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does your mother or your aunt know of your relations
with young—young——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Roland Bayard?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, I think every one in our neighborhood must
know all about it! Because we all know all about our
neighbors, and some say that they know more of us than
we do of ourselves, and that we know more of them than
they do of themselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think that quite likely. But, do your friends approve
of your engagement?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not now; but they will when Roland comes into his
rights.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You poor child!” murmured the earl, in a low tone.
Then, speaking in a clearer voice, he asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rosemary, would you marry this young man without
the approbation of your friends?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, never,” she answered, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is right. Now, then, if your friends were to
counsel you to accept another suitor whom they approved,
would you do so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, never,” replied the child, more emphatically
than before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then what would you do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would be an old maid, like Aunt Sukey. I never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>would marry Roland Bayard against the will of my
mother and my aunt; nor would I ever marry any one
else, even to please them. I would be a maiden lady,
like Miss Susannah Grandiere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Little true heart! Well, little friend, I will not try,
through your guardians, to marry you against your will.
Neither, I think, will I marry any one else. And in any
case, we shall always be friends, shall we not, little sweet
herb?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Always! And it is so good of you to say so!” exclaimed
Rosemary, giving his hand another fond
squeeze.</p>

<p class='c007'>They sauntered on in silence until they overtook Wynnette
and Elva, who had sat down on a garden seat to
wait for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is time to go home to luncheon,” said Wynnette,
“and I am starved.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They turned their steps toward their hotel and reached
it in time to join Mr. and Mrs. Force and Odalite at
luncheon at their usual hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>That afternoon, while Mr. Force was taking his daily
nap and the young girls were resting in their chambers,
the earl found himself alone with his sister in their private
parlor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Elfrida,” he said, “I want you to tell me something
about this little protégé of yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rosemary Hedge?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, she is the daughter of the late Capt. Hedge, of
the merchant service, and of his wife, Dorothy Grandiere,
the daughter of the late Gideon Grandiere, of St.
Mary’s. Her family is one of the oldest and best in the
State. And her friends have intrusted her to us for the
benefit of travel. That is all there is about Rosemary
Hedge.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“No, not quite all. The little one tells me that she is
engaged to be married.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who? Rosemary?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Engaged to be married!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is news to me! I never even suspected such a
thing. Nor do I know how she has ever had an opportunity
of being wooed, far less won!” exclaimed the lady,
in surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And yet the child honestly thinks that you know all
about it,” replied the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know nothing. And I am really distressed at the
news you tell me. Have I been so absorbed in the care
of my sick husband as to have neglected the interests of
the orphan child? What adventurer has picked her up,
in the name of Heaven? Tell me, Francis, if you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know anything of a young fellow called Roland
Bayard?” significantly inquired the earl, fixing his
eyes intently on the face of his sister.</p>

<p class='c007'>That face paled under his wistful gaze; but the lady
recovered herself in a few moments, and replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; he is a young man who in infancy was cast upon
our shores from a wrecked ship. He was cared for by
Mr. Force, who placed him in <a id='t31'></a>the charge of a respectable
woman and afterward sent him to school and to college.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does any one know anything about his parentage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was the sole survivor of the wreck. There was
not a mark on his clothing or on his person to give a
clew to his parentage. But, as Mr. Force has practically
adopted him, he will not need to investigate his own antecedents.
He is in the merchant service now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I have heard so much from Rosemary. But
now as to his character?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is above reproach. A not unworthy namesake of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>two heroes—Roland and Bayard. But why do you inquire
into the history of this young person?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because it is to him that Rosemary is engaged, or
thinks herself engaged.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh,” laughed the lady, “that is an old story.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It cannot be an old story, since the child is but
seventeen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is relatively an old story. When he was a schoolboy
he was much favored by his friends the Grandieres,
who lived at Oldfield, near Forest Rest, where his foster-mother,
Miss Bayard, lived, and where Roland was
reared. Rosemary was a baby. He used to pet her very
much and tell her that she was his sweetheart, and his
little wife, and all such childish nonsense as that. And
I think they kept it up until Rosemary was sent to boarding
school with our girls. Since that time—some five
years ago now—I think there has been no more of it. I
thought it was all forgotten long ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it is not, you see. The child thinks that she is
engaged to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder if she is attached to him,” said the lady,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not quite know. Perhaps, as she believes herself
to be engaged, she may also only believe that she is
attached to him. It is a subject upon which one cannot
very closely cross-examine a young girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, you could not; but I must,” replied the lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Without mentioning my name, if you please, Elfrida,”
said the earl, who also religiously refrained from
telling his sister of his proposal to Rosemary, lest Mrs.
Force should try to influence the girl in his favor. And
he did not wish the latter to be worried or coerced in any
way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly without mentioning your name. I shall
know how to manage with tact and discretion,” replied
the lady.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“One word more, Elfrida. Would you approve of a
marriage between this Roland Bayard and Rosemary
Hedge?” inquired the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I should.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I have not the disposal of the child’s hand, so
my own approval goes for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is enough,” said the earl, and he opened the window
looking from the parlor to the balcony and went
out there to walk and smoke.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI<br> <span class='c005'>A STRANGE MEETING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The middle of October found the Forces with their
party again at Rome, settled in their old quarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>News of the war came by every mail, bringing accounts
of battles fought, and lost or won.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were of those few who in the dreadful struggle
could not take any side. They only longed for peace
and reconciliation. They passed the winter in Rome,
but in the early spring Mr. and Mrs. Force and their
daughters began to long for their native country even
more than for their particular home.</p>

<p class='c007'>There seemed no present prospect of an end to the
fratricidal war. The holocausts of youth, manhood and
heroism offered up monthly to the Devil of Discord did
not seem to appease his rapacity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every mail brought news of new battles and of thousands
and tens of thousands slain on either side; the
storm of war raging more and more furiously as the
months went on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Elfrida!” said Mr. Force one day, “I cannot stand it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>any longer! We must go home, my dear, and be with
our country in her need! Not to burn and slay and rob
on one side or the other, but to nurse the wounded and
feed the hungry, and clothe the naked—and give all our
time, money and energy to this needful work. You and
your daughters and even your crippled husband can do
this much to abate the pain of the age!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had said words to the same effect before, but never
with so much of sorrowful earnestness as now.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, we will go, Abel. Yes; it is indeed our duty to
do so. Besides, our Odalite is wasting away with hope
deferred! We have not heard from Le for so many
months! He may be dead on some crowded battlefield,
or ill and delirious in some hospital, or in some prison!
We might find out his fate by going home. And then
there is poor little Rosemary fretting out her heart about
young Bayard, who has never been heard of since he
sailed with Capt. Grandiere, now nearly three years ago!
We might find out something satisfactory about him.
We all need to go home! There is no one but Wynnette
who is not breaking down under this anxiety and
uncertainty! Wynnette thanks Heaven every day that
Sam Grandiere chooses to stay home and mind his crops.
As for Elva, she makes every one’s trouble her own and
suffers for and with all. Yes, we all need to go home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And our home and our country needs us,” added Mr.
Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>So it was decided that they should return home as
soon as passages for their whole party could be secured.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Force dreaded to tell her brother of the impending
separation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl had grown so much better in health, spirits
and happiness while traveling in their company, that it
would seem like relegating him to gloom, solitude and
despondency to send him back alone to his old life at Enderby
Castle.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>She took the time immediately after breakfast the next
morning to break the news to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Going! Going back to America!” he exclaimed, in
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. It is our bounden duty. The war is not the
temporary disturbance that you thought it was to be.
It is growing more terrible every month. It may last
yet for years. We must go to our home and do the best
we can for everybody,” replied the lady. And then she
went over the whole subject as it had been discussed between
herself and her husband.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my dear, it is your duty to go home,” admitted
the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still, my dear brother, we are very sorry to leave
you. I hope, however, that you will not go back to Enderby
Castle, to your old solitary life there. It is very
bad for you. I hope you will go up to London, and
open your house on Westbourne Terrace, and call your
friends together and entertain them, even though I
shall not be there with my daughters to help you, as I
had once hoped to be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall not go to London, Elfrida. I have no friends
there, and I hate society. No; I shall go to the United
States with you,” said the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t mean it!” exclaimed Mrs. Force, between
surprise, pleasure and incredulity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I do most certainly mean it. I have never seen
America, and though the state of civil war may not be
the most pleasant aspect under which to view a new
country, yet it is certainly the most interesting. And so,
Elfrida, if you have no objection, I shall go with you to
America.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know that I am delighted at the thought of having
you,” said the lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Has Force written to engage passage?” inquired the
earl.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“He intends to write this morning to inquire about the
first ship on which he can get berths for all our large
party to New York.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then ask him to see about two additional berths for
me and my valet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it was arranged that the whole family party, including
the earl, should go to America together.</p>

<p class='c007'>In due time the answer from the agent of the Cunard
line arrived. They could all be accommodated on the
<em>Asia</em>, which would sail on the twenty-third of March.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is the ninth. We have just two weeks to get
ready in. We had best start for Liverpool as soon as
possible and make our final preparations for the voyage
there,” said Mr. Force, after he had read the letter to
his assembled family.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, oh, papa, let somebody go to Enderby Castle
to fetch Joshua,” exclaimed Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, my dear girl, the old dog may be dead,” said
the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, he is not dead! I write to Mrs. Kelsey every
week to ask about dear Joshua, and he is very well. And
he is not at all an old dog. He is only nine years old. I
remember him ever since he was a puppy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it has been over two years since he saw you,
and he has forgotten you by this time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, he hasn’t. We were away from home three
years and three months, and he never forgot us. You
ought to have seen how he met us!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, my dear, when we get to Liverpool, I will telegraph
to one of my grooms to bring the dog to us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear uncle! how I love you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>A week from this time the whole party were settled at
the Adelphi Hotel, in Liverpool, to await the day of
their sailing for New York.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force kept his room. The Earl of Enderby spent
hours in his own apartment with his family solicitor and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>his land steward, both of whom had been summoned by
telegraph to meet him at Liverpool.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ladies of the family spent their days in final shopping,
providing themselves, among other conveniences,
with thick linsey-woolsey suits for sea wear, and with
heavy Astrakhan wool shawls for wraps.</p>

<p class='c007'>In due time the groom from Enderby arrived with
Wynnette’s dog in his charge. Space does not permit to
describe the interview between the two. It is enough to
hint that Joshua, in dog language, bitterly reproached
his mistress for breaking faith with him, and deserting
him for so long a time, and then magnanimously forgave
her, while Wynnette was all apologies for the past and
protestations for the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Saturday, the twenty-third of March, the whole
party embarked on board the ocean steamer <em>Asia</em>, then
at anchor in the Mersey, and bound to sail for New York
at twelve, noon, of that day.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was the usual crowd on deck; with the usual
partings; friends departing, and friends who had come to
send them off; some grave, some cheerful, some merry,
some despondent.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length this was all interrupted by the shout of the
first mate from the poop:</p>

<p class='c007'>“All ashore!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the last hurried good-bys were spoken, and the
last embraces given, and the friends of the voyagers hastened
over the gang plank to the steam tender which had
brought them to the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the farewell gun was fired, and the <em>Asia</em> stood
out to sea—her passengers standing in lines to gaze on
the receding land.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force and his party were walking up and down
the deck of the steamer, when they saw coming from the
opposite direction a figure so remarkable that it would at
once have attracted attention anywhere.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>It was the tall, stout figure of an old man, with a
fresh, red face, clear blue eyes, a white mustache, and a
commanding presence. He wore the uniform of an
American skipper, with its flat, gold-rimmed cap.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he approached Mr. Force stared, and then started
and held out his hand, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Capt. Grandiere! You here! Why, where did you
drop from, and where is Roland Bayard?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The gruff old sailor stopped to lift his cap to the ladies,
and to shake hands all around, and to be introduced to
the Earl of Enderby, and to shake hands with him, before
he replied to Mr. Force’s first question:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My ship, the <em>Kitty</em>, was taken by that infernal pirate,
the <em>Argente</em>. I was set ashore, alone, on the English
coast. I had some correspondents at Liverpool, who
supplied me with funds to return home. That is all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—where is Roland Bayard?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With the pirates.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='c005'>AN OLD SALT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Among the pirates, Capt. Grandiere? Roland Bayard
among the pirates?” exclaimed Mr. Force, while
Mrs. Force closed her lips with a sudden motion and
grew a shade paler. Rosemary began to tremble, and
the other young girls to look anxious.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come aft! Let us find seats somewhere where we
will not be spied or overhauled, and I will tell you all
about it,” said the old skipper, moving down toward the
stern, where the deck was almost deserted by the other
passengers, who were all gathered forward, leaning over
the bulwarks and taking a last look at the receding shores
of England.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>They found seats on the wooden benches, and sat
down.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old skipper took off his cap and wiped his large,
red face and close-cropped gray head, and then said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t expect to see you here. I should as soon have
thought of seeing Oldfield farmhouse standing up before
me, right in my path, as a group of old neighbors, with
my little niece in the midst of them. Heavens and
earth—how a civil war shakes people up! I dare say,
now, you all left on account of the war.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” said Mr. Force, “we left before the war to
visit my brother-in-law here, and to give our young people
some advantage in foreign travel. My own ill health
has detained us abroad for more than two years. We return
now on account of the war.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good Lord! Abel Force, you are not thinking of going
into the army in your crippled condition!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not exactly. But we can all be useful in the
hospitals—even my wife and daughters—in caring for
the sick and wounded soldiers, and for the widows and
orphans of the dead, so far as our strength and means
will go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! that is something else! When did you hear
from the folks at home? I have not heard from them for
years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I got a letter a week ago from your niece, Miss Grandiere.
Your nephew, William Elk, is in Richmond, on
Gen. Lee’s staff; your nephew, Thomas Grandiere, is in
New Orleans, with Gen. Butler, and your grandnephew,
Edward Grandiere, is with Farragut, in Mobile Bay.
Sam has elected to stay at home, follow the plow, and
take care of the women.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sam has the only solid head in the family, except my
own! Look at that, now! Brothers and kinsmen shooting
each other down, running each other through the
body, blowing each other up, as if they were at war
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>with a foreign enemy! Oh, Lord! Lord!” groaned the
old skipper, flinging down his cap with force upon the
deck, and furiously wiping his perspiring face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is grievous enough; but it is human nature, and
we cannot change it. The strangest part of it all is that
the men composing the rank and file of each army have
no personal ill will toward their antagonists. Each fights
from a sense of duty. Each invoke the blessing of God
upon their arms. There was a time, Grandiere, in our
lives, when peace reigned so long that we all began to believe
that war belonged only to history, and barbaric history
at that, and had passed away forever, as one of the
last relics of barbarism. It was the Mexican War that
woke us up from our dream of the millennium. And,
since that, there has been in one part of the civilized
world or another almost incessant and most ruinous war.
So when we call ourselves a Christian, civilized and enlightened
people——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We tell a lot of bragging lies! Out with it, papa, in
plain English!” put in Wynnette, who had held her
tongue until it ached.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is this girl?” inquired the old skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My second daughter, Wynnette. Surely, I introduced
her to you,” said the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you did! But there are so many of them, you
know! I used to dandle this one on my knee when she
was a baby; but she has grown out of my knowledge!”
said the old skipper. Then turning to Wynnette, he
grasped her hand, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Right you are, my dear! We are a lot of braggarts
and ignoramuses! So far from being Christians, civilized
and enlightened, we do not even know what these
terms imply. We are heathen, barbarians, and we live
in the twilight. Right you are, my dear, as to your
opinions, but wrong in your way of putting them. Interrupting
your father. Discipline should be maintained,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>my dear. Remember that!” said the old skipper,
not unkindly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the astonished Wynnette could reply, Rosemary
put in her piteous little plaint, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Uncle Gideon! dear Uncle Gideon! Tell us
about—about——” She meant to say “Roland Bayard,”
but she reddened, and substituted: “The pirates!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course! That is what I brought you here for.
You have heard about the pirate Silver, and his ship, the
<em>Argente</em>?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have seen notices of depredations made by the
<em>Argente</em>. It is a privateer in the Confederate service,
is it not?” inquired Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Privateer? Yes, and worse! It is a pirate! In the
Confederate service? No; no further than running the
blockade, to carry in merchandise to sell at ruinous
prices, would go! The <em>Argente</em> is a privateer, a blockade
runner, a slaver, and a pirate. Just as, a few years ago,
we thought war had passed away from the face of the
earth forever, so we thought that piracy had been swept
from the sea. But we were mistaken in both cases. Our
Civil War, the blockading of our Southern ports, the
emancipation, and consequent stampede of the negroes,
have brought into action a fleet of sea robbers who call
themselves privateers, and pretend to be in the service
of this or that faction, but who are really pirates and
slavers. They are armed to the teeth and are manned
by the most reckless desperadoes gathered from all
nations—mostly jail birds, convicts, criminals. They
take our merchant ships, they steal slaves from the West
Indies, run the blockade and sell them in our Southern
ports; or, with equal impartiality, when opportunity is
given, they decoy slaves from the Southern plantations
by the promise of a free passage to the North, and they
carry them to the West Indies, where they sell them to
the planters. The most notorious of these brigands of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the sea is the <em>Argente</em>. I have never yet heard of any
of them being taken.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old sailor having talked himself out of breath,
stopped, wiped his forehead, and flung his rolled handkerchief
with force upon the deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Uncle Gideon—dear Uncle Gideon—tell us
about—about the pirates,” pleaded Rosemary, pale with
sorrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My pet, I have told you about the pirates,” grunted
the skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—but—about—about—the loss of the <em>Kitty</em>,”
pleaded Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old skipper snatched up his cap from the deck and
flung it down again with violence. Then he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes! Devil fly away with them! They took the
<em>Kitty</em>! I can’t talk about it, girl! The devil takes possession
of me every time I think of it! They took the
<em>Kitty</em>! That is all that is in it! Maybe some time or
other, when the devil forsakes me, I will tell you all
about it, but not now—not now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell us something at least of Roland Bayard,” said
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did tell you! He is among the pirates.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But in what capacity? Is he a prisoner or a volunteer?”
persisted the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! oh, Wynnette! Roland Bayard could never be
a volunteer among the pirates. He would suffer himself
to be killed first! Yes—to be tortured to death first!
Yes—yes—to be slowly tortured to death first! Oh,
Roland! Roland!” wailed Rosemary, too deeply distressed
for her childhood’s friend to conceal her emotions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. Grandiere, touched by the trouble on the quaint
little face, pulled himself together, patted her head, and
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t cry, little girl! Roland is not a volunteer in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the pirate crew. I never believed that for one minute,
though Silver, the head devil, told me so. No, my
child, he is a prisoner among the pirates—I am sure of
that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, then that is some comfort! I would rather they
should keep him a prisoner, or even kill him, than make
him wicked! Indeed, I would, Uncle Gideon. But how
comes he to be among the pirates and you here? He a
captive, and you free? Tell me that, Uncle Gideon,”
said the little creature, with a shade of reproach in her
troubled tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>And while Rosemary waited in suspense for the answer
there was another who listened anxiously to catch
its every word. This was Elfrida Force.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <span class='c005'>THE LOSS OF THE “KITTY”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I will tell you, my girl, though I hate to talk of it.
About a month ago I sailed from Havana, bound to London,
with a cargo of rum, tobacco and sweetmeats. The
weather was fine, and we had a good voyage until we
came within four or five days’ sail of port. A sail had
been following us all day long. We did not know she
was following us, nor could we make out by our best glass
what she was. She was the only sail in sight. As night
closed in she gained on us. That was certain. But still
we could not make her out. She did not come near
enough for that, for the <em>Kitty</em> is a pretty fast clipper herself.
As night darkened we lost sight of the strange
sail, without any misgivings. But in the gray of the
morning she was alongside of us! Hold on! The devil
is getting into me again!” exclaimed the old sea dog,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>snatching Mr. Force’s hat from his head and flinging it
with vehemence upon the deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fortunes of war, captain—the fortunes of war!
Be patient!” said Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fortunes of murder, robbery, arson, piracy!
There was no fight!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The will of Providence, then.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The will of the devil! You shan’t lay their murders,
and robberies, and arsons, and piracies upon Providence!
That would be blasphemy! There was no struggle!
What could our unarmed little Baltimore clipper do—though
every one was a hero—against a pirate ship of
twenty-four guns, manned by the desperate offscourings
of the galleys and the convict prisons, all armed to the
teeth, bristling with pistols, daggers and cutlasses? Nothing
at all! They boarded us, walked into us and through
us, and made prisoners of our men, took possession of our
ship, then put the men into two open boats and sent
them adrift, to sink or swim, carried off me and young
Roland captives to their own deck, and finally sent off an
officer and a detail of their devilish pirates to work the
<em>Kitty</em>—and Satan only knows where they carried her
and her valuable cargo of rum and tobacco! We parted
company then and there. I never saw young Roland
after that. I believe he did make some resistance, and
was wounded. I saw him bleeding and carried below,
and I never saw him again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the captain made an involuntary dash at the
earl’s cap, but his hand was intercepted by Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll scalp us next,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Umph! Umph! Umph!” grunted the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Uncle Gideon! Oh, Uncle Gideon!” moaned
Rosemary, while Mrs. Force gripped her own hands
firmly in silent trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t cry, honey! I believe he is safe enough and
will turn up all right. I called them murderers! And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>no doubt at all, some of that criminal crew were murderers,
and worse than murderers, if such could be! But
they did no murder in my sight! They might—had
they chosen—they might have massacred all hands
aboard the <em>Kitty</em>, but they didn’t! They put the men
in open boats and set them afloat to take their chance;
and then—for some reason well known to himself, but
quite unknown to me—Capt. Silver took young Bayard
and myself on board the <em>Argente</em>. I said I never
saw Roland after he was taken down below, nor did I!
But I did not fail to inquire for him. The head devil
told me that the young man was all right; that his wound
was only skin deep; that his men never killed or wounded
men whom they could so easily overpower and capture
without bloodshed; and especially in the case of a fine
young seaman who might become useful to them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Uncle Gideon! Then they did only take Roland
on board to make a pirate of him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course they did, my dear; for when I asked to
see Roland, Silver told me, with a satanic laugh, that the
young man was ‘in retreat,’ preparatory to entering his
novitiate in the holy orders of bold buccaneers, roaring
sea rovers, and that no outsiders should have access to
him, for fear they might shake his good resolutions and
even win him back to the selfish world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a devil!” exclaimed Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Every day I inquired about Roland, and each day I
received answers which would have made me believe that
the boy was gradually being persuaded to become a pirate—if
I had not known that Roland Bayard could
never become so perverted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, never, never, never!” firmly declared Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But while Bayard was kept a close prisoner, I had
the run of the deck,” continued the captain. “One day
I asked Silver where he was bound. He told me, with
infernal insolence, that he should touch on the coast of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>England, put me on shore, and then go about his own
business. Two days after, we came to anchor on a lonely
part of the coast of Cornwall. It was a dark night, and
they put me in a boat and took me ashore and left me
there, with just two sovereigns in my pocketbook. They
had robbed me of thousands, but they left me that much
to take me to London. I don’t know why, I am sure,
that it should sometimes occur to a scoundrel to stop
short of the extreme wickedness he might perpetrate!
But at all events, Silver did stop short of the crime of
leaving me penniless to perish at night on a desolate seacoast.
I passed the night in a solitary fisherman’s cottage.
In the morning there was not a sign of the <em>Argente</em>
to be seen. She had sailed again. I walked to the
nearest railway station, distant twelve miles, and there
I took the ‘Parliamentary’ to London—for I had to economize
my small funds. I went down to the West India
Docks, where I was as well known as the church clock,
and saw some of my correspondents, told my story, got
all the money I wanted, and took the express to Liverpool;
reached there yesterday, engaged a berth, and
here I am!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was your ship and cargo insured?” inquired Mr.
Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From keel to masthead,” answered the skipper. “But
that was against fire and water and accidents. Now, I
don’t know whether being taken by a pirate would be
considered as coming under the clause of accidents or
not. But, anyway, you know the insurance companies
are bound to make a fuss before they pay a cent. They
always do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your losses, then, I fear, may be heavy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but not ruinous, even if the insurance companies
do not pay, because I have still the <em>Blue Bird</em> that
George sails.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is Capt. George now?” inquired Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“In the China seas somewhere if he has not been taken
by a privateer. But where is your nephew, Leonidas?”
inquired Capt. Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We do not know. We have not heard from Le for
many months. When we last heard it was through a
letter from him dated on board the United States ship
<em>Eagle</em>, then about to sail under sealed orders. We are
all, therefore, naturally very anxious,” replied Mr.
Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ay! ay! These are anxious times for us all. But, at
any rate, the man-of-war is safe from the pirates, who
prey only on unarmed merchantmen. Hope the sealed
orders were to go after the privateers—that is, pirates.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The conversation was interrupted by the sound of the
dinner gong, and passengers began to troop down from
the deck to the dining saloon. Seasickness had not yet
come on to take away their appetites.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl, who had been a silent, though interested,
listener to the story of the old skipper, and who had his
own private opinion of young Roland Bayard’s position
in the pirate ship, arose and drew the arm of Rosemary
within his own, to take her down to dinner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Capt. Grandiere offered his to Mrs. Force. Mr.
Force took his eldest daughter, and Wynnette made a
manly bow and took Elva under her protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so they went down to their first dinner on the
<em>Asia</em>, and their last for several days, for a more stormy
passage than that of the <em>Asia</em> which sailed on that March
morning was never weathered by ocean steamer.</p>

<p class='c007'>After dinner the old skipper went on deck to smoke
his pipe alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Forces went down into the ladies’ cabin, to look
at their staterooms, arrange their effects, and get comfortably
settled in their quarters before seasickness
should overtake and disable them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our party occupied three staterooms in a row, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>right-hand side of the cabin as you entered it from the
forward gangway.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nearest the gangway was the stateroom of Mr. and
Mrs. Force; next to that the one of Odalite and Elva;
and last of the three was that of Rosemary and Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the three rooms were exactly alike, and each had
a door opening into the cabin, and opposite the door a
little window looking out on the sea and sky. On the
left hand as you entered there was a wide berth at the
bottom and a narrow one at the top. On the right hand
was the wide sofa. Under the lower berth and under
the sofa were deep drawers to hold the sea wardrobe and
other effects of the passengers. In the angle between the
side of the window and the end of the sofa was a stationary
washstand, with all needful accessories. In the
angle between the other end of the sofa and the door
leading into the cabin was a stationary lamp, locked up
in a heavy plate glass box, and carefully lighted and
locked up every night, and unlocked and extinguished
every morning, by the stateroom steward. The little
door of this glass box or closet was in the general cabin,
so that the lamp could be attended without intrusion
into the stateroom. For the rest, all the fittings of the
staterooms were “cabinet finished”; the floor was covered
with a thick crimson Brussels carpet; the berths
and the windows curtained by crimson satin damask, and
the sofa covered with crimson moreen. Under the stationary
lamp was a corner bracket of black walnut,
with three shelves to hold books, or anything else that
could be contained on the limited space.</p>

<p class='c007'>Below the Forces’ quarters was a long row of staterooms
exactly like their own, and on the opposite side of
the cabin a corresponding row, all occupied by ladies and
families who were total strangers to the Forces, and perhaps,
in many cases, to each other also.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>The ladies’ cabin was fitted up very much as most
well-appointed steamer cabins are, with handsome carpet,
sofas, easy chairs, mirrors, water coolers, and so
forth. Down the middle stood a long oval table, at
which you could sit and read, or write, or sew, or talk
with companions. This table was lighted at night by
three large chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Forces were well pleased with their quarters.
And as for the girls, they were always running in and
out of each other’s rooms, comparing and admiring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only Mrs. Force was anxious about the comfort of her
invalid brother. His stateroom was in the gentlemen’s
cabin. She would hear when they should meet at tea
whether he were well accommodated.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had scarcely completed their arrangements when
the gong sounded to call the passengers to tea.</p>

<p class='c007'>They went up to the saloon, where they were joined
by the earl and the old skipper. Their party of eight
just filled one table, which they thenceforth kept for
themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old skipper was installed at the head of the table
and the squire at the foot. Mrs. Force and the earl sat
on the right and left of the skipper. This arrangement
of the four elders was maintained for the whole of the
voyage, but the four young people sat as they pleased.</p>

<p class='c007'>This table had two waiters, and they were well attended.</p>

<p class='c007'>In answer to Mrs. Force’s questions the earl gave her
a good account of his stateroom, adding it was near that
of the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this the whole party went up on deck for a
promenade. The setting sun was striking a broad path
of glorious light across from the western horizon to the
bows of the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It seems the course of our voyage,” said Odalite.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“We are sailing toward the setting sun, and just now
in its path of flame.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There were many more people on the forward deck;
but after the sun had dropped below the horizon the
wind gradually freshened and it grew very cold.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Mr. Force proposed that they should leave the
deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>They all went down to the saloon and gathered around
one of the vacant tables, where the captain entertained
them with sea yarns, and even sang a sea song.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were many other groups of passengers gathered
at the other tables, but they were still strangers to our
party, when the old skipper began to sing his song
with its roaring refrain of:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>

<p class='c007'>Conversation stopped at all the tables, and all the people
turned to listen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently several joined in the chorus and made the
saloon ring again with melody.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the close of the song the singer was loudly applauded;
but he excused himself from repeating the experiment.</p>

<p class='c007'>At ten o’clock supper was served for those who wished
it; but as our party were not among that number they
left the saloon and retired to their berths, where they
were all soon rocked asleep by the motion of the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so ended their first day out.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The next day the passengers all arose early to go on
deck; but most of them had to lie down again before
they had finished dressing; and to remain in their staterooms,
where they were attended by the stewardess.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ship was approaching Queenstown.</p>

<p class='c007'>All our party, however, came upon deck. Some of
them were sick enough, but they all thought that the
fine air of the upper deck was better for them than the
close air of the staterooms, or even of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weather-beaten and weather-proof old skipper and
his grandniece, little Rosemary Hedge, were the only
ones who remained perfectly well, with a keen appetite
for breakfast and a wholesome enjoyment of the sharp
March morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is it with you, my girl?” inquired the skipper,
when they all met in the bows and exchanged their morning
greetings and compared notes about endured or
threatened sickness. “How is it with you? You look as
fresh and as bright as a brand new sixpence, and you are
as steady on your pins as if you had been to sea all your
life!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has been to sea longer than that!” put in Wynnette,
the incorrigible. “She is only seventeen years
old, but she has been to sea about two hundred years
to my certain knowledge! And how many thousand
years before that I don’t know! And if she has not exactly
followed the sea, in her own person, she has in
that of her ancestry, on both sides of the house. Her
father was a sailor, her two grandfathers were sailors,
and her four great-grandfathers. And from them she
has inherited her good sea legs.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“No—doubt—of—it. No—doubt—of—it,” slowly
and approvingly replied the old skipper, as he gazed admiringly
on his little niece. “Ah! if she had only been
a boy, what a sailor I could have made of her!”</p>

<p class='c007'>They were drawing very near to Queenstown now, and
in less than half an hour the <em>Asia</em> dropped anchor in
the Cove of Cork.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the ship was still the seasick got well and
went down to breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>After that they returned to the deck, to look out upon
the coast of Ireland.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the <em>Asia</em> was to wait there for some hours to get
the last mail, many of the passengers went on shore.
Our party remained on the steamer.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the afternoon the excursionists returned. The ship
made preparations for sailing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our party sitting on deck, and all feeling perfectly
well now that the ship was still, overheard some “grew-some”
words from one of the men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That bank of clouds in the west means mischief
and dirty weather ahead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you hear that, Jack Tar?” inquired the old skipper
of his little niece.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Uncle Gideon,” she answered, lifting her large,
blue eyes to his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And do you know what ‘dirty weather ahead’
means?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Uncle Gideon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what does it mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, it means furious storms to come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you ever hear the phrase before?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Uncle Gideon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then how do you know what it means?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know; but the meaning seems plain enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! then I must tell you how you know. By instinct.
By inheritance. Just as the blind kitten knows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>a dog the instant it scents his approach. I should think
you would know not only what dirty weather means,
but also the signs of its coming.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even I, who am neither a sailor nor the son of a
sailor, can tell the signs of its presence,” said Wynnette.
“They are a ship deluged with rain and dilapidated by
wind, slopped all over by waves, and holding several
hundred human wretches, all deadly sick at their stomachs.
If that is not dirty weather, I don’t know the
meaning of words.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And that is just such weather, Miss Wynnette, as
we shall be likely to have, more or less, for the next ten
days, or longer. And the officers and men know it and
are preparing for it. But never you mind, little Jack
Tar. We shall not go down. And as for the rest, you
can stand the storm. You’re a natural born sailor!”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the old skipper spoke the signal gun was fired, and
the <em>Asia</em> steamed out of the cove.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun had now set behind a heavy bank of clouds.
The wind had risen with more force than on the preceding
evening, and blew so freshly that all the passengers,
with the exception of a few weather-beaten men
and well-seasoned voyagers, went below.</p>

<p class='c007'>All our party, with the exception of the old skipper
and his little niece Rosemary, not only went down, but
turned in to be looked after by the hard-worked stewardess,
or not unfrequently by one of the stewards.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t want to go below to the stifling cabins,
do you, now, little Jack Tar?” inquired Capt. Grandiere
of his small companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Uncle Gideon, I do not, indeed. I should much
rather stay up here with you as long as I may,” replied
the child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thought so! And so you may. Ah! if Heaven had
given me such a boy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Uncle Gideon, although I can walk the deck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>when the ship is rolling, without falling or turning sick,
I know I should not make a good sailor boy,” said Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not, pray? I say you would make a splendid
sailor boy! Why, every one of the passengers has gone
down and turned in as sick as dogs, and here you are as
well as I am!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I couldn’t be a sailor boy, because——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I should be afraid to climb the ropes and
things so high. I should be afraid of falling on the
deck and killing myself, or falling into the sea and getting
drowned,” pleaded Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, don’t go to tell me that you have inherited your
sailor forefathers’ sea heads and sea legs without their
stout hearts! Don’t go to tell me that!” said the skipper,
taking his pipe from his mouth and staring down at his
little companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quaint little creature looked so ashamed of herself
that the old man took pity on her, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, well! you are nothing but a bit of a girl, after
all, and the very tiniest mite of a girl, for seventeen
years of age, that I ever saw in my life! Well, you
shan’t be a sailor and work on board ship! You shall be
a dainty little lady in your own house:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘With servants to attend you</div>
      <div class='line in4'>When you go up or down.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Come, now! tell you old uncle a secret: Isn’t my lord
sweet on you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the old sailor took his pipe from his mouth and
poked the stem of it into her side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Sweet on me?’” echoed Rosemary, in perplexity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In love with you, then. Every girl knows what that
means as soon as she knows her right hand from her left,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>or sooner. Tell me the truth, now—isn’t the earl in love
with you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no!” exclaimed Rosemary, in all sincerity; for
although she knew that Lord Enderby had proposed to
marry her, it never occurred to her to think of his being
“in love” with her, or anybody else, because she considered
him so much too old for her—old enough to be her
father, as in truth he was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, then I don’t know the weather signs in that
latitude! That’s all. His eyes are never off you, child.
If he has not told you he loves you, he will do so soon.
You must then refer him to me. I am the head of the
family, and in the lack of your father, must stand in his
shoes. You are very young to marry, Rosemary—only
just seventeen. And I should accept his lordship’s offer
only with the understanding that he should wait for you
a year; but then I should accept him, my girl; for it is
not often that an English earl offers marriage to the
daughter of a merchant captain, even though she is a
little beauty and does come of a good family. And
Enderby is a good sort. That is better than being an
earl. He is a good sort.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the old man put his pipe in his mouth and
smoked on in silence for some minutes, during which
Rosemary sat by his side in dumb distress.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last the skipper took out his pipe, blew off a cloud
of smoke that went floating over the sea, and then he
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you understand, my dear, that I, the head of your
family, entirely approve the suit of Lord Enderby.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rosemary was ready to cry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Uncle Gideon, I don’t want to marry the earl! I
like him so very much! I love him—I love him dearly!
He is the best man I ever saw in my life! And I do love
him dearly, dearly; but I couldn’t marry him, and I
wouldn’t marry him for the whole wide world!” exclaimed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Rosemary, with her little face and frame all
quivering with her earnestness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well—upon—my—word!” muttered the old skipper,
laying down his pipe for good and all, and staring
at his little niece, but to no purpose, for they were sitting
in deep shadow now, and he could not see her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You love the earl dearly, and would not marry him
for the world! That is crazy talk. What do you mean
by it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, one does not want to marry people because one
loves people. I love you and Uncle Force, and Cousin
Le, and Sam and Ned, and ever so many more; but I
would not marry any of you for all the world, even if I
could. And I love Lord Enderby more than I do all the
others, but I would not marry him. I would die first!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, I know what is the matter. The secret is out!
You love some one else even better than you do the earl!
Is not that so? I am the head of the family, Rosemary,
and I have a right to know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle,” whispered the little creature, in a tremulous
voice, as she clasped her tiny hands over her heart,
speaking frankly under the friendly cover of the darkness—“uncle,
I am not free to marry the earl, even if
I wished to do so, which, indeed, I do not. I am engaged
to Roland Bayard!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good Lord bless my soul alive!” exclaimed the old
man. “Since when, if you please?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I don’t know, Uncle Gideon; but I have been engaged
to Roland for years and years and years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bless my soul and body!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a sacred bond, and I wouldn’t break it even if I
could.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! the love that grew from childhood—was that it,
Rosemary?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, dear Uncle Gideon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, he’s a good sort, too—is Bayard.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>As the old skipper spoke, one of the stewards came on
deck with a message from Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would Capt. Grandiere be so good as to send Miss
Hedge down to the ladies’ cabin, as it was too late and
too cold for her to remain on deck?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will take you down myself,” said the old man.</p>

<p class='c007'>And he escorted the girl to the door of her stateroom,
and bade her good-night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rosemary was soon asleep in the upper berth of the
room she shared with Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the old skipper spent hours on deck before he
turned in.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER X<br> <span class='c005'>THE PRIVATEER “ARGENTE”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What a night!</p>

<p class='c007'>The wind rose to a hurricane! It had a thousand
voices! It hummed, sang, whistled and hurrahed, as it
danced in the rigging. It moaned, wailed, howled and
shrieked, as it knocked the ship about. The steamer
rocked, tossed and tumbled in the stormy sea; now rising
high upon a heaving wave, now dropping into the gulch
of the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Passengers could not sleep that night. It was as much
as they could do to hold on and keep their places in bed.
Those on the upper berths were in danger of serious
falls.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rosemary, who shared Wynnette’s stateroom, and
slept in the upper berth, let herself down by a series of
difficult but successful gymnastics, and lay upon the
sofa, trembling. Presently she crept to the door, opened
it a little way, and peeped into the cabin. The place
was quiet, the doors of the other staterooms all closed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>and no one present but the local night watchman, sitting
composedly by the single light.</p>

<p class='c007'>She closed the door, crept back to the sofa and lay
down again. Presently she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wynnette! how can you sleep through this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sleep!” cried Wynnette. “Who’s asleep? Not I!
Who could sleep through such a demoniac opera as this?
Rosemary! the Germans swear ‘Ten thousand devils!’—in
their own language—and I think the whole ten thousand
German devils must be holding an open-air concert,
after the manner of their musical countrymen, and that
right around our ship! Only, they are all roaring drunk,
and every one singing and playing and piping and blowing
out of tune! I never heard such a hullabaloo in
my life!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Wynnette, do you think there is any danger?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I don’t. If there was, the passengers would all
be out of their berths and dressed, to be ready for the
lifeboats. And there would be a great running and racing,
and pulling and hauling, and cursing and swearing
on deck; and the officers would all be—blaming the
men’s eyes, and livers, and lights, to—encourage them,
you know. And making a hullabaloo to be heard above
the hurricane. And much more horrible than the hurricane,
too. No; there can be no danger yet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But would all that profanity go on in a beautiful
ocean steamer?” inquired Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A good deal of it would on occasion. You may bet
your best boots on that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I wish it was morning!” sighed Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So do I. But ‘if wishes were horses, beggars would
ride,’ you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning came at length, however, and as the sun arose
the wind went down, but not entirely, for it still blew
and often started up in gusts.</p>

<p class='c007'>None of our party appeared at the breakfast table, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>even afterward on deck, except the old skipper and Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day passed wearily.</p>

<p class='c007'>At intervals Capt. Grandiere visited the earl in his
stateroom, and Rosemary her friends in their own. Both
visitors found the sick ones cross and sulky, and so indisposed
to be friendly and social that they were speedily
left to themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>People are no more responsible for their behavior
when they are seasick than if they were lunatics.</p>

<p class='c007'>At night all hands turned in early. And the wind rose
and blew a hurricane all night.</p>

<p class='c007'>And as the day had passed, so the week passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sunday came. As the weather continued to be tempestuous,
the passengers remained seasick.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one came up on deck except the old skipper and his
grandniece. The old man was dressed in his Sunday
clothes, and carried a Bible, a prayer book and a hymn
book in his hand. He drew his little companion away to
a comparatively sheltered part of the deck, and they
sat down to read the service for the day—the old man
reading the minister’s part from the book and the young
girl making the responses from memory. Then he read
the lessons for the day; and finally they sang a hymn.</p>

<p class='c007'>At dinner time they went to the saloon, but found it
almost deserted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ensuing week proved quite as tempestuous as the
one just passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were, in fact, suffering from a series of equinoctial
storms.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the ship reached the Banks of Newfoundland
they experienced some variety of weather in the shape of
blinding snow and stinging sleet, added to howling winds
and leaping waves.</p>

<p class='c007'>None but the officers and crew of the steamer and our
old skipper ventured on deck.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Even Rosemary stayed below. It is hard enough to
keep one’s feet on a rolling deck when it is dry, or on an
icy surface when it is still; but to stand or walk on the
sleety boards of a rocking ship is well-nigh impossible
to any one but a seasoned old salt.</p>

<p class='c007'>So Rosemary, as well as her companions, kept the
cabin or the saloon.</p>

<p class='c007'>To as many as were able to appear on the common
ground of the last-mentioned place the old man made
himself very useful and agreeable in helping them to
pass away the long days, and especially the long evenings.
He told stories, sang songs, and recited poetry—miles
of poetry, which he said he had committed to memory
in the lone watches of his half century of sea life.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this time the steamer was not “flying,” not even
“running,” but, as it were, only tumbling against wind
and weather toward the port of New York.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it happened on one fine morning, when the winds
and the waves fell and the sun shone brightly and
warmly, and seasick passengers got well and came out on
deck like hibernating animals in the spring—they spied
a pilot boat—Number 15—coming toward them.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a general jubilee! They were not yet in
sight of land, but they could not be far from port, for
the pilot boat was coming!</p>

<p class='c007'>Half an hour later the pilot boat was alongside and
the pilot on deck, with a batch of the latest New York
and Washington papers, and with news—such news!</p>

<p class='c007'>A crowd gathered around him at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>His papers were taken right and left, and all the men
turned eagerly to the first columns of the first page of
his own particular sheet to read:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Latest Dispatches from the Seat of War.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Before every man’s face fluttered the open newspapers
like spread sails, while they devoured the news!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>But the pilot’s oral news, which was so very fresh that
it had not had time to get into the morning papers, was
more interesting to our immediate party than all the
rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force, who was deep in news from the peninsula,
caught the words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lieut. Com. Force.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And he looked up.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pilot was hastily and excitedly recounting some
adventure to a group of men gathered around him to
listen. Among these was the old skipper Grandiere, who
seemed eagerly interested.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pilot spoke hurriedly, for he had presently to take
command of the ship to carry her into port.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force dropped his paper and joined the group.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?” he inquired of Gideon Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the old man was too intent upon the words of the
pilot to hear any others.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?” inquired Mr. Force again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the pilot stopped to answer him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The blockade runner <em>Argente</em>, Capt. Silver, sir!
Taken off the coast of South Carolina, by the United
States ship <em>Eagle</em>, Capt. Warfield. Silver and his first
officer, and all his crew who were not killed in the fight,
taken prisoners and put in irons. The <em>Eagle</em> put a part
of its own crew on board the <em>Argente</em>, under command
of Lieut. Force, who brought the prize safely into
port this morning, with Silver and his first officer in
irons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven!” exclaimed Capt. Grandiere. “But
do you call her a blockade runner only? She’s an infernal
pirate! She took my <em>Kitty</em>! And Silver shall
hang for it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the <em>Argente</em> is now in New York harbor?” inquired
Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“No, sir. She was telegraphed from the navy department
to sail at once for Washington. And she sailed an
hour ago.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XI<br> <span class='c005'>WHERE IS ROLAND?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Where is Roland? Oh, Mrs. Force, where is Roland?
He was on the pirate ship, you know! Oh, was
he wounded in the sea fight? Was he taken prisoner?
Was he killed? Oh, was he killed?” breathed little Rosemary
Hedge, pulling at the lady’s dress and lifting her
light blue eyes beseechingly to the lady’s face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us hope that he has been rescued, my dear, and
brought home in honor, since you know he was himself
a captive among the pirates,” replied Elfrida Force,
whose face looked quite as pale and anxious as the distressed
little face turned up to hers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—but—does not the pilot know? Can he not
tell us? Will not some one ask him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think he has told all he knows, my dear! Remember
the <em>Argente</em> was only in port a few hours this morning,
after the morning papers were out, and before the
afternoon papers were out. The pilot put to sea at once.
He could not have got but an outline of the facts, and
perhaps not even a true outline.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Uncle Gideon!” pleaded Rosemary, leaving the
side of Mrs. Force and joining the old skipper. “Oh,
Uncle Gideon, won’t you please ask the pilot if he heard
of any prisoner among the pirate crew, rescued from
them by the <em>Eagle</em>, or if he heard anything at all of
Roland Bayard?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes, child, I will ask him,” promptly replied
Capt. Grandiere, pushing to the front of the group, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>hailing the pilot, who was elbowing his way through the
questioners who would have detained him longer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ahoy, shipmate! Not so fast! Answer one question,
and then you may go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what is it?” demanded the pilot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heard you of any honest prisoner rescued from the
pirates?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heard you of any man of Roland Bayard?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! never heard that name before! There were but
two names talked of—Nichol Silver, the captain of the
blockade runner, and Craven Cloud, his first officer,”
said the pilot, now breaking away and hurrying aft.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And they’ll both be hung as high as Haman, or my
name is not Grandiere, and I never commanded the
good ship <em>Kitty</em>, and she was never taken from me, with
all her cargo, by the piratical craft <em>Argente</em>, devil sink
her! Blockade runner, is it? No doubt in the world
she was a blockade runner! But she was so much worse
than that that she was a pirate of the worst order! Attacking
and taking unarmed merchantmen, and committing
Lord knows what atrocities besides! Ah! I’m glad—I’m
glad I didn’t stop longer in England! I’m glad
I came over, so as to be able to give evidence that will
hang the pirate captain and his mate! I shall take the
first train to Washington, after landing! I must be on
hand to give my evidence as soon as possible, or those
devils will be claiming to be treated as prisoners of
war, because they were taken while trying to run the
blockade! Prisoners of war, indeed, after taking my
peaceable <em>Kitty</em>, with her cargo, and sending her crew
adrift! We’ll see when I get to Washington! My
evidence will hang them as high as Haman!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you think a fifteen-foot gallows and a five-foot
fall would be quite as effectual, Capt. Grandiere?” inquired
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“What do you know about it?” demanded the skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing at all! That is the very reason why I was
turning the question over in my mind and asking for
instructions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Mr. Force! Oh, Mr. Force! What has become
of Roland?” pleaded Rosemary, in a low, wailing voice
as she took the squire’s hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish I could satisfy you, my dear, but I cannot.
We may learn something from the evening papers when
we land in New York. If we do not we shall certainly
find out when we reach Washington, where we shall
meet Le.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, how soon shall we go to Washington?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the first train after we land. Of course, you
know, we did expect to spend a few days in New York,
but this news has altered all our plans, and we shall go
on immediately to Washington.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To-morrow? Early to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, to-night! So that we may be in the city to-morrow
morning!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then,” said the quaint little being, “I must bear the
suspense as well as I can and trust in the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, in the meantime, remember, my dear, as your
uncle said, we have every reason to hope and expect that
Roland is safe on board the <em>Argente</em>. Being already a
prisoner on board the blockade runner, he could not have
been in the sea fight, and, therefore, he could have been
neither killed nor wounded. If taken prisoner by the
<em>Eagle</em>, among the rest, he must soon have told the story
of his capture, and he must have been recognized by his
friend Le, and released and brought home in honor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Rosemary, in her grave, demure way, “I
think that is very probable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And we are going to Washington to find both our
lads, Le and Roland.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Oh! Lord grant it!” fervently exclaimed Rosemary,
clasping her tiny hands and lifting her light blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force turned to look at his daughter Odalite.</p>

<p class='c007'>What a change had come over the pale, grave face of
the girl. Her cheeks and her lips were glowing with fire,
her dark eyes were sparkling with light.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you think of all this, my dear?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, father! I feel so happy! so happy! Le has distinguished
himself! Le is the hero of the day! Thank
Heaven! Oh, thank Heaven! We shall see Le in a few
hours from this! See Le safe, well and honored! Thank
Heaven! Oh, thank Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force looked at his wife. Her face was very pale
and troubled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear Elfrida,” he said, “you let your sympathy
for little Rosemary Hedge and her lover affect you without
cause. I think there is no doubt the young man is
now quite safe on board the <em>Argente</em>, on her way to the
Washington Navy Yard. We shall land at New York
about sunset. We shall leave our effects at the custom
house and take the night express for the South. We
shall reach Washington before the <em>Argente</em> gets there;
but we shall wait for her, and as soon as she arrives we
shall find both the boys safe—Leonidas and Roland—safe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are very, very good,” she replied, in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is the gong for dinner. I have an appetite for
the first time in ten days,” he said, gayly, as he drew his
wife’s arm within his own to take her down.</p>

<p class='c007'>At all the tables in the dining saloon nothing was discussed
but the war news. Gen. Grant was slowly fighting
his way on to Richmond, opposed by an army that
was daily wasting away under toil, fever and privation,
but who made up for want of numbers with indomitable
courage, endurance and self-devotion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>After dinner the passengers all went up on deck to
watch for the first glimpse of land.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many had glasses, through which they looked long
and wistfully to the westward, and then passed their instruments
on from hand to hand among the less fortunate
passengers who had none of their own.</p>

<p class='c007'>Often they mistook a cloud lying low on the horizon
for a line of coast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently some one staring through the glass cried
out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Land!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing but a low cloud!” cried another man, staring
through another glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Highlands!” cried the first speaker.</p>

<p class='c007'>And in a very few minutes “The Highlands!” was the
verdict of all on the outlook.</p>

<p class='c007'>The progress of the ship was now very rapid.</p>

<p class='c007'>She soon passed the Narrows, and stopped.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quarantine officers came on board. No ship ever
came into the harbor with crew and passengers in a
healthier condition, Mr. Force’s chronic rheumatism
being the only case of indisposition on board. So the
<em>Asia</em> was allowed to go on her way, and reached her
pier a little after sunset.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force at once landed with his party, taking only
such luggage as they had used during the voyage, and
which could be carried in the hands of the servants.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was duly examined and passed by the custom
house officers; the bulk of their luggage to be afterward
brought on by the groom of Lord Enderby, who was left
in charge.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a train for Washington at nine o’clock. It
was now seven.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had time to go to a hotel and take tea.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had scarcely left the custom house officers before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>they were assailed by a swarm of newsboys crying their
papers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eve-en-ing——” this, that, or the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Latest from the Perningsalar!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Capture of the blockade runner <em>Argente</em> by United
States ship <em>Eagle</em>!” etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hi! Boy! Let us have a paper!” called Mr. Force,
as they were swarming past him to a large group of men
who were also just off the steamer, famishing for news
and calling for venders.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two or three turned back.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force and the earl bought papers from all of
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment the negro valet who had been sent for
carriages came up with two.</p>

<p class='c007'>The papers were distributed to the members of the
party and they entered the carriages, the four girls in
the front carriage, and the four elders in the hind one—and
read as they drove along.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, in fact, they learned nothing more from the papers
than they had learned from the pilot, except that
there were more details of the fight which ended in the
capture of the privateer by the man-of-war.</p>

<p class='c007'>This word “privateer” always put the old skipper into
a rage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Privateer!” he exclaimed. “They might as well call
an assassin a mere sneak thief. She is a pirate of the
most devilish description. She took my unarmed <em>Kitty</em>.
She seized her cargo. She sent her crew adrift in open
boats in midocean. And I’ll hang all hands for it. I
swear it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think you could hang a whole ship’s crew,”
laughed Lord Enderby.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, may I be blowed from a cannon’s mouth myself
if I don’t hang the head devil and his mate! That’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>what I’m going to Washington for—to make my
charge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In good time they reached their hotel, took their tea,
and sat down to rest and read the papers at their leisure
before starting on their night journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here a little surprise met the whole party. When
Mr. Force tendered a ten-dollar goldpiece in payment of
his bill at the counter of the office, the coin was rung suspiciously
on the board, then examined critically, and
finally dropped into the till. And he was handed a ten-dollar
greenback and a two-dollar greenback in exchange,
with the information that he would find it all
right, as gold was that day at one hundred and twenty
per cent. premium.</p>

<p class='c007'>This information so astonished the simple squire that
he did not recover himself until he had reached the
railway station at Jersey City.</p>

<p class='c007'>The party arrived in full time to purchase their tickets
and take their seats.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XII<br> <span class='c005'>ON TO WASHINGTON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Everybody is happy but me! Oh, Uncle Gideon, I
have looked all over, up and down, and everywhere in
the papers, and I cannot see one word about Roland!
Oh, Roland! Roland!” moaned little Rosemary, as she
sat on the seat beside the old skipper in the crowded car.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My poor little girl, such a small item as the rescue
of a single prisoner from the pirate ship would scarcely
be noticed in a first hurried account of the capture by
the <em>Eagle</em>. Have patience, my dear little one. In a few
hours we shall hear from Le himself whether Roland is
with him. And remember, my girl, that you are going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>to meet your dear mother and aunt, and all your near
relations, whom you have not seen for so many years,
and who are counting the hours until you come to them.
Think of your own kindred, my child.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! I do, I do! And I do love my dear mother and
dear aunt, dearly, dearly! But they are both safe and
well, and so I am not anxious about them. But, oh!
Roland! Roland!” she wailed, in a little, low tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Force, who sat beside her husband immediately
in front of Rosemary and her uncle, heard the little, low
moan, and turning to the squire, said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Abel, dear, will you change seats with little Rosemary,
and let the child sit with me for a while?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly,” replied Mr. Force, and the change was
effected at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Force put one arm around Rosemary’s waist,
and drew her in a close embrace, as she whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must pray, and hope, and trust, my dear. We
have no reason to fear that any evil has happened to
Roland.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, ma’am, I am praying all the time, in my heart,
for Roland,” sighed the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, darling, when you pray, you must trust.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I do try to! I do try to! But this dreadful uncertainty!
Oh! just look how happy Odalite and the
other girls are! But Odalite—every time she turns her
head around her face flashes! She is so delighted! Oh!
I hope I am not envious, but I do wish I felt as sure of
seeing Roland safe and well as you all are of seeing
Leonidas great and happy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Force smiled, pensively, at the exaggerated
words of the poor little girl, but she did not attempt to
criticize them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was now nearly ten o’clock, and in spite of excitement
and anxiety the travelers yielded to a sense of fatigue
and drowsiness, ceased to talk, and began to doze.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>There was no sleeping car on that train, or if there
was, the party had not engaged berths, so they sat in uneasy
attitudes, and dropped off, one by one, into slumber,
that was only disturbed by the stopping of the train at
the stations, and quickly resumed when the train was
again in motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>They woke up thoroughly when they reached Philadelphia,
where several more cars were attached to the
train, and a number of troops got on to go to Washington,
en route to reinforce Gen. Grant’s army. Many of
these soldiers could not find seats, though the train was
a long one, and they had to stand in a line down the middle
of the cars.</p>

<p class='c007'>This made the air stifling, oppressive and stupefying.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our party dropped off into a deep, unwholesome sleep,
which lasted until the train reached Baltimore, when
they one and all awoke with a sense of sickness and semisuffocation.</p>

<p class='c007'>But here people got in and people got out, doors were
opened at each end, and a draught of purifying air went
through and revived the sufferers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here still more cars were attached to the train, and
more troops got on, and the crowd was even closer than
before.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again our victims succumbed to the stupefying effects
of the confined air, and slept heavily and unhealthily
until they reached Washington.</p>

<p class='c007'>Day had dawned when the train crawled into the
depot.</p>

<p class='c007'>The closely packed multitude got out, and filled all
the space that was under cover.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force piloted his party through the crowd, and
out into the open air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I doubt if we can get a carriage,” said the squire,
looking around.</p>

<p class='c007'>And his doubts were speedily and unpleasantly set at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>rest. He could not. If there had been any on the spot
they had been seized by the first travelers, who had
jumped off the train to secure a ride.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is nothing for it but to walk to our hotel.
Luckily, it is not very far off,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a fine morning, and dawn was reddening in the
east as they left the depot and walked on toward Pennsylvania
Avenue. They walked somewhat stiffly at first,
from having been cramped up so long in the railway
train, but the fresh air was reviving, and so they all felt
more invigorated at every yard by their progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>They reached the hotel with fine appetites for breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force found, on inquiring at the office, that the
house was full; there was not a room or a bed to spare;
but the house could give them breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>So they waited in the public parlor until the breakfast
hour came, when they went down into the saloon and
took their morning meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>After breakfast Mr. Force went into the reading room
to inquire about the <em>Argente</em> and to look at the morning
papers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rest of his party waited for him at the foot of the
stairs leading to the parlor.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last he came and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The <em>Argente</em> has not yet reached the navy yard, nor
has she been heard from since leaving New York yesterday
morning, but she is expected to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what are we to do next?” inquired Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You and the girls will remain here, in the ladies’
parlor, and read the newspapers, or amuse yourselves in
any way you please. Capt. Grandiere is going to see
the secretary of the navy to report the capture of his clipper,
the <em>Kitty</em>, by the <em>Argente</em>. Enderby will go out
with me in search of lodgings. We must find some place
to sleep in this overcrowded city. And we must get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>out of it as soon as we can. As soon, that is, as the <em>Argente</em>
business is settled and Leonidas gets his leave.
We shall all return here in time for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words Mr. Force opened the door of the
parlor and saw the ladies of his party in.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was yet so early that the parlor was quite empty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think you might venture to recline on some of these
sofas and go to sleep,” said the squire, as he nodded good-morning
and left the room, accompanied by the earl and
the skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they went down, left the hotel and stood upon
the sidewalk, Mr. Force looked up and down the streets
in search of that line of hacks which usually stands
drawn up before every large hotel. But it was not to be
seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inquiry of the porters developed a startling fact—nearly
all the horses in Washington had a plague called
epizoötic. There were but few hacks in the public service
now, and they were always “on the go.” There were
but few street cars running, because there were but few
horses to draw them, and they were always overcrowded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shall we walk, Enderby? Or shall we stand on the
reeking platform of one of these passing cars?” Mr.
Force inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, walk, by all means, as long as we have a leg to
stand on, in preference to adding three hundred pounds
more to the burden of those poor beasts,” promptly replied
the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fortunately, all the best hotels are on or near the
avenue,” observed the squire, as they turned westward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, doesn’t it seem as if war were quite enough of
evil without a plague among the horses, Enderby?” inquired
Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may thank Heaven that the plague is not among
the humans,” replied the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“Here is the Metropolitan. We will try here,” said
the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>And they went in, but were not successful; the house
was full.</p>

<p class='c007'>So hotel after hotel was tried, but in vain. All were
full. The two gentlemen walked on toward the west
end of the avenue. There at length they found, in one
of the largest and best hotels in the city, a suit of three
rooms—two double-bedded chambers and one single one.</p>

<p class='c007'>These were secured at once for their party of eight,
and at a rather high price, too.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they went back to the place where they had
left the ladies of the party.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old skipper had already returned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force reported progress, and described the best
apartments he had been able to find.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see there is scarcely space left for us in Washington.
We must get back to old Maryland as fast as we
can,” added the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. Grandiere followed suit and told of his adventures.
He had not been able to see the secretary at all.
Anteroom full of lubbers who were seeking offices or
other favors. He had to wait his turn, and before his turn
came a fellow opened an inner door and announced that
the secretary could see no one else that day, and added
that he had gone home. Then he—the skipper—had
gone down to the navy yard to inquire about the <em>Argente</em>,
and discovered that the prize had been signaled
from Fortress Monroe and was expected to be at Washington
Navy Yard the next day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you shall see as fine a sight as you could wish
when I am confronted with that devil to-morrow! He
expects, by what we read, to be treated as a prisoner
of war, and to be put on his parole and set free. He
certainly doesn’t expect to find me on hand to stop his
little game and send him to prison to be tried for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>life, and in the end hung for piracy!” added the old
skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, if we could only hear from Roland!” sighed little
Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be patient, dear. We shall hear to-morrow,” whispered
Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! ‘To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow!’”
sighed Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will go down and get some luncheon, and then
go on to our new quarters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And to-night we shall sleep in motionless beds for
the first time in two weeks, thank Heaven!” exclaimed
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>They went down to the dining saloon and lunched.
Then Mr. Force settled the bill and the whole party
went out.</p>

<p class='c007'>The squire caught a hack “on the fly,” put his five
ladies into it and gave the driver the address. The hack
drove off.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three gentlemen walked all the way to the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they reached it and were gathered in the parlor
some little discussion took place as to the division of
three rooms among eight persons. And it was concluded
that the four girls should have one of the double-bedded
rooms; the earl and the captain should have the
other; and Mr. and Mrs. Force should have the small
one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The party retired very early that night, and in spite
of anticipations of the morning they all slept profoundly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII<br> <span class='c005'>THE CAPTAIN OF THE “ARGENTE”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Our travelers arose very early the next morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very first news that met Mr. Force on his entrance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>into the gentlemen’s reading room was, that the
<em>Argente</em> was in the navy yard. She had arrived at dawn
that morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The squire hastened to the ladies’ parlor to communicate
the news to Mrs. Force and the girls.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a general exclamation of joy, and then a
cry of sharp anxiety from Rosemary:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! when shall we find out about Roland?” she
pleaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This very morning, dear child! No more to-morrows!
To-morrow has come!” replied Mrs. Force, with
a smile—yet, oh! how wan a smile!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come down to breakfast at once. We will get a cup
of coffee or something, and then start for the navy yard
and go on board the <em>Argente</em>,” said the squire, giving
his arm to his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>They went down to the saloon and breakfasted as well
as they could for the excitement, which took away their
appetite.</p>

<p class='c007'>After that, Mr. Force went out to hunt up a carriage,
for there was none on the stand. When he returned,
he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My children, I could only get one hack, and it will
hold but four persons inside. Your Uncle Enderby
does not wish to go out. Therefore, Wynnette and Elva,
you will remain here under the protection of your uncle,
until we come back. Your mother, your sister, and your
little friend will go with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But where is Uncle Gideon?” inquired Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My child, chains would not have held him here. He
has gone down in an omnibus to the navy yard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Preparations were soon made, and Mr. Force and
the three ladies were on their way to the east end of the
city.</p>

<p class='c007'>They drove through the navy yard gate, past the officers’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>quarters and the workshops, and down to the water
side.</p>

<p class='c007'>There lay the <em>Argente</em> at anchor a few hundred yards
from the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force directed the driver to draw up.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he alighted from the carriage and handed his
wife down; Odalite and Rosemary sprang out unassisted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Odalite’s face was bright, eager, expectant; Rosemary’s
pale, timid and anxious; both stood looking out
upon the prize.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How shall we reach the ship?” inquired Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must signal for a boat to come off and fetch us!
Stay, there is a boat coming,” announced the squire, and
soon they all saw the boat that had been partly hidden
in the shadow of the ship’s hulk, put off from her side.
It was rowed by six sailors and approached the shore
rapidly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is in it? Oh, if it should be Roland!” aspirated
Rosemary, in a low, deep tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is it, Abel?” inquired Mrs. Force of her husband,
who was looking through a field glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is but one man besides the oarsmen, and his
back is toward us. I do not know who he is; but—he is
neither Leonidas nor Roland! He is much too stout for
either of our boys! He is as broad-backed as old Gideon
Grandiere!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the way, where is Capt. Grandiere? You said he
had come down to the yard; but we have not seen him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, he was a full half hour in advance of us,
and must be on board the <em>Argente</em>, giving the officers and
crew the benefit of his views on piracy! Come, the
boat is almost here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>A few minutes after the boat landed, the sailors drew
in their oars and the single passenger turned around,
got upon his feet, and stepped ashore.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was the old skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“Oh! Capt. Grandiere! What news?” exclaimed Mr.
Force, while all his party looked the eager question
which they did not put into words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No news at all! Nothing but a fresh disappointment
and a longer suspense.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean?” inquired Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old man took off his cap, drew his red bandanna
from its crown, deliberately wiped his face and head,
replaced the handkerchief in his cap and his cap upon
his crown and answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s nobody aboard that can tell me anything, or
that will tell anything if they can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And did you learn nothing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing but this: that Lieut. Force has gone to make
his report at headquarters, and nobody knows when he
will be back. And the pirate and his mate are gone before
the commissioner of prisoners, and nobody knows
what their fate is to be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And did you hear nothing—nothing at all of Roland?”
inquired Rosemary, in a faint voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing whatever, my girl! I did inquire, but no
one knew anything of any young man of that name. I
am very sorry, my poor child.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rosemary had grown very pale and looked as if she
were about to faint.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old skipper raised her in his arms and laid her in
the carriage, where she sank back upon the cushions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Force got in, seated herself beside Rosemary and
drew the suffering girl to her bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have courage, my love,” she whispered, through her
tears—“have courage. Roland may have made his escape
from the <em>Argente</em> before she was captured by the
<em>Eagle</em>; or he may be, by a mistake, with the other prisoners
on board a man-of-war. Have courage, dear love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Mrs. Force, I cannot—I cannot any longer! I
feel as if I should give up and die!” moaned the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Mr. Force handed Odalite into the carriage, and then,
turning to the old skipper, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Capt. Grandiere, if you will get in with the ladies, I
will take a seat with the driver, and we will all go on together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will take the seat by the driver, and thank you, if
you will allow me; but I cannot be shut up in the inside
of that hack; I would rather walk,” replied the old sailor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As you please,” said Mr. Force; and he helped the
skipper to mount the box, and then entered the carriage
and seated himself with his “womenkind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where to, sir?” inquired the driver.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the office of the commissioner of prisoners; and
on your way call at the hotel where you took us up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The carriage drove off, passed through the navy yard
gate again, and took its way up Garrison Street to Pennsylvania
Avenue, and thence to the West End.</p>

<p class='c007'>Half an hour’s rapid drive brought the party to the
front of their hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear,” said the squire to his wife, “I cannot take
you and these girls to the commissioner’s office. I will
take you upstairs, and ask your brother if he would
like to accompany me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, Abel,” replied the lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force got out, handed down his wife and the
young ladies, and escorted them into the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>They found the earl and his two nieces in the parlor.
The two girls started up with the question:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What news?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No very definite news,” replied their father; “but
your mamma will tell you all we have learned. I am going
to the office of the commissioner of prisoners, to
see if I can meet Le. If I can, I will wait until he is at
leisure, and bring him here. Enderby, would you like
to go with me and see what it is?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“Very much,” replied the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the two men went out together. They entered
the carriage, which was driven off immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was but a short drive, and in less than ten minutes
the carriage drew up, and the gentlemen alighted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. Grandiere climbed down from his seat, and the
three entered the building together.</p>

<p class='c007'>The place had once been a commodious dwelling
house, but was now, like many others of the finest mansions
in Washington, taken for the service of the government.
A sentinel was on guard before the door. Mr.
Force spoke a few words to him, and passed on with his
party. He entered a front hall, and thence through a
door on the right they passed into a large front room,
furnished with seats all around its walls, and a long table
at its back, with chairs behind it, and folios and stationery
on its top. Two or three men in uniform sat
behind this table, while all around the room, on the
benches against the walls, sat a rough-looking score of
men guarded by soldiers. There was another door on
the right of the long table, and opening into a rear room.
A sentinel or janitor stood at that door.</p>

<p class='c007'>While they waited to be admitted to the presence of
the commissioner, the door opened, and two prisoners
came out, guarded by a detachment of soldiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There he is! There is the head devil—and not in
irons, either! And there—there, in his company—a
prisoner, too, by all that is atrocious!—is my mate, Roland!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The two gentlemen looked up, stared at the prisoners
who were slowly crossing the room to the outer door,
closely guarded by the soldiers—stared until the elder
and stouter of the two lifted the back of his hand to his
forehead in a mock salute, and smiled, while the younger
fixed a gaze of yearning entreaty upon the face of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>old captain, and then turned the same gaze upon his old
friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes! the pirate’s first officer, taken, red-handed, with
him, was Roland Bayard!</p>

<p class='c007'>But who was the pirate himself?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV<br> <span class='c005'>WHO HE WAS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“You say this man is the captain of the <em>Argente</em>?” inquired
Mr. Force of the old skipper, when the prisoners
and their guard had passed out of the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes! He is Silver—Silver, the pirate captain! No
irons on his wrists yet! Prisoner of war, is he? Ah! ah!
we shall see—we shall see! But my brave Roland!
Taken with him! This, then was the blockade runner’s
first officer whom they were talking about, who was
taken with him, and is now sent to prison with him!
Oh, Roland! Roland! Is it possible that you yielded
to temptations to join in a lawless life! But it will cost
you your own life, Roland, my lad! No rescued prisoner
from the pirate’s clutch are you, Roland, but a comrade
of pirates yourself! I thought I knew the boy! I
thought I knew him for an honest lad! But I was mistaken
in him! Oh, how mistaken I was!”</p>

<p class='c007'>While the captain was muttering these lamentations
to himself, Mr. Force was standing in a maze of perplexity—not
thinking then so much of Roland as of the
pirate captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl touched him on the shoulder and aroused
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know the villain!” he said. “I have much cause to
know him! His name is Stukely—Byrne Stukely—once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>a lieutenant in the royal navy, but cashiered years
ago for dishonorable conduct.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force stared at the speaker, but did not reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, Force! You look as if you knew the fellow
also! You look as if you ‘could a tale reveal.’ What
is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know the man. But I know him as Angus Anglesea,
Esq., of Anglewood Manor, late colonel in the East
India Service.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, Force! That fellow! He is not Anglesea!
He never was in the army in all his life. He was in the
navy, and kicked out for disgracing it. Is he the man
you have known to your grief as Anglesea?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, Force, the mystery that puzzled me is solved.
The inconsistency that distressed me is reconciled. I
never could understand how you could accuse my friend
Angus Anglesea, the Christian gentleman and renowned
soldier, of the base and cowardly crimes committed by
your persecutor! How could I associate theft, forgery
and bigamy with such a character as that of Angus Anglesea?
Though they are very consistent with the career
of Byrne Stukely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is this man? And how is it that he could take
the name and style of an officer and a gentleman, and
deceive us all, even my wife, who had known Col. Anglesea
in his youth?” demanded the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl shrugged his shoulders and then replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fellow is a near relation of Anglesea, and bears
a strong personal resemblance to him. In their youth
and early manhood they were counterparts of each
other; but as they have grown older they have diverged
in appearance, so that now no one could mistake the one
for the other. The reason is this—both boys inherited
the same form, features and expression from the same
remote ancestor; but they inherited different dispositions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>and have had different trainings. Each has grown
old ‘in the likeness of his love,’ and so they have now
grown apart. Angus Anglesea is of medium size, as well
as of medium height; his features are clean cut, his complexion
clear and pale; his expression grave, sweet,
thoughtful, benevolent, intellectual. Stukely is, as you
see, overgrown, with an obese form, bloated features, red
face, and a brutal, sensual, and sometimes ferocious expression.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” replied Abel Force, “and the last three years
of lawless life has made him even more brutal than
ever.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was in his earlier life a protégé of Anglesea’s. It
was his influence that got him into the royal navy. But
he is and has been for years a sharp thorn in the side of
Angus, taking advantage of his personal resemblance to
his cousin, using his knowledge of his relative’s affairs
and his skill in imitating his handwriting to swindle
every one everywhere who came under his notice. This
was the adventurer who tried to marry your daughter,
Force. It is well the marriage was stopped at the altar,
though the California woman, poor soul, had no right
to interfere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why?” demanded Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because Stukely has a wife and five children living
near Anglewood on the charity of Angus Anglesea.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven!” exclaimed Abel Force, earnestly.
“There is now nothing to prevent the happiness of
my dear Odalite and Leonidas.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know what you are both talking about, I am
sure,” complained the old skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, you do not know our family history for the last
six years, Capt. Grandiere, or the trouble we have suffered
through that man of whom we have been speaking;
but you shall know all at our earliest convenience.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“But Roland! Oh, Roland! What will become of
my boy?” groaned the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can you not prove that he was taken prisoner by
the pirate?” demanded Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but I cannot prove that he did not join the pirates,
as Silver told me that he meant to do. And here
he is under a false name—Craven Cloud, first officer to
the pirate captain! It looks black! I wish I had never
lived to see this day!” groaned the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>After they had waited about half an hour in the hope
of seeing Le come out of the commissioner’s office, Mr.
Force went and spoke to the messenger at the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know whether Lieut. Force, who brought
the prize ship with the prisoners this morning, is now
with the commissioner?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir; he is not. He came with the prisoners this
morning and made his report, and left them, and then
went up to the navy department,” replied the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you! That will do! Come, Enderby! Come,
Grandiere! We may as well return to the hotel! We
shall not be likely to find Le! We must wait until he
comes to us, I suppose! If he only knew what good
news waits him he would hurry!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he only knew that we were in the city, or where
to find us! But he does not, you see,” said the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait one moment,” exclaimed the captain. “I must
speak to that man before we go. Can you tell me where
those two prisoners have been sent?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the Old Capitol prison?” replied the messenger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can I get to see them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only by a permit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go on, Force! You and the earl! I am going to see
my dear boy! Oh, Heaven! who shall tell poor Rosemary?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XV<br> <span class='c005'>LEONIDAS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“What do you think of this case of young Bayard?”
inquired the earl, as the two gentlemen drove back to
the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot think! I have never in my life felt so
amazed, so confused, and so uncertain! The sudden
meeting of Anglesea——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stukely, my dear friend! Stukely!” interrupted the
earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stukely, then! the man we have known as Anglesea—and
now known as the blockade runner, slaver and
pirate—has—demoralized my mental faculties!” exclaimed
Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you believe Bayard to be a voluntary confederate
of the pirate?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! no! If you put the question in that way, I say
no! I do not believe it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The young man was a protégé of yours, I have
heard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yet you do not know his parentage, or what traits
of character he may have inherited, which may have
been kept down by circumstances, and only wanted opportunity
to spring into life and activity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have known Roland from boyhood; I have watched
over him as over a dear son; and I have never seen a
low, base, or false trait in his character. His words, his
deeds, and his thoughts—so far as I could read them—have
always been pure, and true, and high. I cannot
think of him in any other light than that of my long
knowledge of him—I said from his boyhood. I meant
from his babyhood.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“I hope the young fellow’s character may be vindicated.
But his case looks very bad just at present.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope much from his old captain’s interview with
him. Roland may be able to explain his position to our
satisfaction. I shall wait anxiously for news from the
captain. Or Le may be able to throw some light upon
this subject. He may be able to tell us why Roland was
brought home as a prisoner, instead of as a rescued man.
We must wait for more light, Enderby.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. In the meantime, shall you tell the poor little
girl the truth of Bayard’s position? Is it necessary that
she should be told, just at this point, when we know so
little, and that little is so—perhaps—needlessly alarming?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. I think not. I will not tell Rosemary that he
is a prisoner. I must tell her only that he is alive and
well, and that he will come to see us as soon as he can.
Here we are at the hotel. And, thank Heaven! we have
good news for Odalite! Our darling is free—absolutely
free—and may marry her faithful betrothed to-morrow,
if she pleases!” said Abel Force, as he alighted from the
carriage, followed by the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>They went upstairs together, and entered the parlor,
where they found Mrs. Force and the four young girls
anxiously awaiting them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you find Le?” eagerly inquired Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! did you find Roland?” breathed Rosemary,
clasping her hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Odalite, Wynnette and Elva looked all the interest
they did not put into words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my dears, we did not find Le, but we heard
of him. He and Roland are both in the city, and both
alive and well; and both will come to see us as soon after
they shall have found out that we are in Washington as
they possibly can,” said Mr. Force, throwing himself into
a chair.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“Where are they now, papa, besides being in the city,
which is a place of ‘magnificent distances,’ you know?”
inquired Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, Le is—everywhere—except here! Le is—ubiquitous!
He is a will-o’-the-wisp! We have spent
the day in following him about. He was on his ship—but
when we got there he was gone to the navy department,
and when we reached there he was off to the office
of the commissioner of prisoners. When we arrived at
the last-mentioned place he was gone back to the navy
department. So we came here to report and get a little
rest and refreshments, and then we are going down to
the navy yard to board the <em>Argente</em> and wait there until
we see him. He is sure to turn up on the <em>Argente</em>—well—sooner
or later, as he is in command.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And—Roland?” softly murmured Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Roland, my dear, is alive and well, but he does not
know where you are any more than Le does. We must
find Le and let him know that we are here,” said Mr.
Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, with a total change of manner, he began:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come here, Odalite, my dear, and sit beside me. I
have such good news for you as shall give you patience
to wait for Le, if he does not come here for a week. But
such news that, if he knew it, would bring him within an
hour!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Full of vague expectancy, Odalite came and threw
herself down on the sofa beside her father, and looked
up into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear Odalite, what would be the very best news
that you could hear to-day?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>Odalite gazed into his eyes, too much excited to speak.
Fearing, indeed, to speak, lest his next words should disappoint
her raised hopes, while Mrs. Force and every occupant
of the room, except the earl, waited breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“Oh, tell me, papa! tell me what you have to tell!”
pleaded Odalite.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me, first, what would be the best news you
could possibly hear to-day?” persisted Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>His daughter gazed into his face, while her color went
and came—came and went; but she did not speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Odalite?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Father,” she then answered, gravely, “the best news
that I could hear, that any of us could hear to-day, would
be that the war was ended, the country at peace, and the
North and South friends again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A conscientious reply, my dear. That would certainly
be the best news that any of us could hear. But
it is not the news that I have to tell, my love. Try
again. My news is of a private nature, and concerns
yourself. What would be the best news that you could
hear concerning yourself?” persisted the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That I were free!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The words came in a tone of impassioned aspiration
that spoke volumes of the suffering the girl had endured
under the incubus that darkened and oppressed her life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, my dear, hear it!” said the squire, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Odalite, you are free!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Father!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The cry came from her soul, and it was echoed by her
sisters and her friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Abel!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was from his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my dears, it is true!” replied the squire. “Odalite
is free!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anglesea is dead, then? Our terrible enemy is
dead!” exclaimed Elfrida Force, with a sigh of infinite
relief.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my dears, Anglesea is not dead, I thank Heaven!
Long may that gallant soldier and true gentleman live
to enrich humanity! But your enemy is dead to you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Odalite! You are free, my child! As free as either of
your sisters! And you have always been free, my dearest
dear, although I did not know it until to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the meaning of all this?” demanded Elfrida
Force, in a voice of doubt and pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell your sister, Enderby. Tell them all—and all
about it! I cannot. I am not equal to the task! I
should talk like a fool!” said the squire, drawing his
handkerchief from his pocket, and wiping his brows.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus adjured, the earl looked around on the group
of eager listeners, and said, addressing Mrs. Force:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may remember, Elfrida, how amazed and incredulous
I was when you told me of the disgraceful career
of one whom you called by the name of my nearest
and dearest friend—Angus Anglesea.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes! yes!” eagerly exclaimed the lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And with good reason was I thus amazed and incredulous!
To think a gentleman of purest honor in
one hemisphere should become an unmitigated scoundrel
in another, was simply impossible! I did not, and could
not, comprehend the enigma, and I did not try!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But sometimes you nearly lost your temper with us!”
put in Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did; because I thought you ought to have known
my brother officer better than to have believed him
guilty of all the crimes of which he was accused! Elfrida!
I had forgotten one matter that might have
cleared up the mystery at once! And that matter was the
existence of Byrne Stukely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Byrne Stukely!’ Who was he?” inquired Mrs.
Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was the man who, under the name of Angus Anglesea,
tried to marry your daughter, but failed so signally
that he has not even the shadow of a shade of
claim upon Odalite! She will not need the slightest
action of the law to free her from that incomplete ceremony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>begun in All Faith Church! No, my dear; Odalite
Force, as my brother-in-law has just said, is as free
as either of her sisters! Byrne Stukely has a wife and
half a dozen children, more or less, living in the town
of Angleton, and supported by the charity of Angus
Anglesea!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But who then, in the name of Old Scratch, is this
Byrne Stukely?” demanded the irrepressible Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, wait until I tell your mamma! Byrne
Stukely is a distant—very distant—relation of Angus
Anglesea, and yet the two distant cousins were, up to the
age of twenty or thereabout, as much alike as twin
brothers. They must each have inherited the form, features
and complexion of some common ancestor; but
there all the resemblance between the men ended; for
one inherited all the virtues of his progenitors and the
other all the vices! They were as opposite in character
as they were alike in form. This resemblance lasted, as
I said—lasted in its completeness—until the young men
grew to be about twenty years of age, when the character
of each began to impress itself upon his face, manner
and expression. Anglesea developed into a man of
the highest and purest moral and intellectual excellence,
and became a Christian gentleman and soldier.
Stukely sank down to the level of the beasts, and below
them—and became a bloated, brutalized criminal
and sensualist. No one, who has known both for the
last twenty years, could possibly mistake one for the
other. Each has grown ‘into the likeness of his spirit,’
and therefore they have grown far apart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I ought to have known he was an impostor!” put in
Wynnette. “I don’t mind other people being deceived
in the fellow! but for me—me—not to know, the minute
I saw the portrait of the real Col. Anglesea, that the
other fellow was a fraud!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There were many other people deceived in times past
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>by the exact resemblance between the two men! It was a
source of continual embarrassment to the Angleseas of
Anglewood. The father of Angus Anglesea procured
for young Stukely a midshipman’s warrant, and got him
sent off to one of our most remote naval stations, to get
him out of the way and get rid of him. He went on
pretty well for a while. And he received much indulgence,
too, for the sake of the benefactor behind him
But rectitude was not the forte of Byrne Stukely, and in
the end he disgraced his patron and was dismissed the
service.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how came he in the army?” inquired Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was never in the army. He was no more a colonel
than he was an Anglesea. Nor more a soldier than
he was a gentleman. He was in the navy, as I said, and
was kicked out of it. Lastly, he has turned up in the
slave trade and the general piracy line of business as
Capt. Silver.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Capt. Silver!” echoed every voice, except that of
Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my darlings—Capt. Silver, of the <em>Argente</em>.
Ostensibly blockade runner only. Subject only to the
laws of war—to be held only as a prisoner of war. But
really a slaver and a pirate, likely to be tried for his life
and hanged for his crimes by this government; or if he
should chance to escape conviction and execution here,
where the punishment of crime is so very uncertain,
still sure to be claimed by the British Government,
under the extradition act, and hanged by us, who, you
know, will stand no nonsense from slavers and pirates.
But now, my darlings, let us leave the subject of the villain
and turn to something pleasanter. Odalite, my
dear, I congratulate you on your escape. And I hope,
when we go down to the <em>Argente</em> this afternoon, we
shall be able to bring Lieut. Force back with us.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“Heaven grant it!” breathed Odalite, in a low and fervent
voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is Capt. Grandiere?” inquired Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has gone to look up his mate, young Bayard,”
replied Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I hope he will bring Roland back with him!”
sighed Rosemary, who was the frankest little creature
in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope he may,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come! Let us go down to dinner,” suggested the
earl.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVI<br> <span class='c005'>THE OLD SKIPPER’S DESPAIR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile, Capt. Grandiere, having obtained his
pass, got into a crowded street car, en route for the Old
Capitol prison. After toiling up the long hill on the
north side of the Capitol grounds, the car turned into
East Capitol Street.</p>

<p class='c007'>There the old skipper got off and inquired his way to
the “Old Capitol”—a large pile of brick buildings, looking
not unlike a warehouse, but which in its time, before
the present beautiful edifice had been raised, was used
for the councils of the National Congress, and now was
turned into a military prison.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. Grandiere found the place—though it looked
very much like a Baltimore tobacco depot—and then
went up to the main floor, at which a sentry stood on
guard.</p>

<p class='c007'>He showed his pass. The sentinel scrutinized it, returned
it to him, and let him in.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>He entered a broad passage, with doors on either side,
and a staircase in the midst. These doors were all closed,
and a sentry stood at every one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish to see young Ro—Mr. Craven Cloud,” said
the captain, correcting himself—“one of the officers
taken prisoner on the blockade runner <em>Argente</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The sentry to whom he addressed these words looked
at his pass, and said, laconically:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old man climbed the stairs, and found himself in
an upper passage, with other doors on each side, and another
staircase in the midst. These doors were also
closed and guarded by sentries.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to see Ro—Mr. Craven Cloud, one of the prisoners
from the blockade runner <em>Argente</em>,” said the skipper,
handing his pass to the nearest sentry, who looked
at it, and answered, shortly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old man groaned, and slowly mounted the second
flight of stairs, to find himself in a passage exactly like
the one below in all respects of doors, sentries, and a
third staircase.</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain, panting from his long ascent, repeated
his formula, and handed his pass, which was returned to
him, with the answering formula.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old man, feeling fatigued and dizzy, began to ascend
the third flight of stairs. When he reached the top
he found himself in a passage precisely like those below—closed
doors, armed sentries, and a fourth staircase,
probably leading into the garret.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been a sailor for sixty years, and hope to sail
the seas for sixty more! Men have lived hale and hearty
to extreme old age, and why not I, who never was drunk
or ill in my life? But if I have to go up another flight
of stairs I shall be cut off in my prime!” said the captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>to himself, as he leaned, puffing and blowing, against
the freshly whitewashed wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I feel just like the</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Youth who bore through snow and ice</div>

      <div class='line in20'>Excelsior!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Which must mean ‘Upstairs.’ And like him, I shall
drop dead at the top. Say! you, sir! I want to see Mr.
Craven Cloud, who was taken prisoner from the blockade
runner <em>Argente</em>. Here’s my permit,” said the old skipper,
as soon as he could get his breath, handing his pass
to one of the sentries.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Room at the end—Number 53,” said the soldier, returning
the paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven, that is a change for the better!” exclaimed
the old man, trotting up the whole length of the
passage to a board partition that seemed to have been
temporarily put up across the end.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sentry stood before the door in this partition, and to
him the skipper gave his pass.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sentry unlocked the door and admitted the visitor
into the small room that had been partitioned off from
the front end of the passage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The place was clean, fresh and light, but had no furniture
except one narrow iron bedstead with a mattress, a
pillow and a white spread as clean as the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Extended on the mattress lay the young and handsome
form of Roland Bayard, clothed only in his white shirt
and gray trousers. His hands were clasped above his
head and his eyes were open and fixed on the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>He started up on hearing the visitor enter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Roland! Roland! My dear boy, Roland!” cried the
old skipper, in a tremulous voice, while the tears started
to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>If the two had been French or German, they would
have fallen into each other’s arms. Being Americans of
English descent, they only clasped hands a little more
firmly than usual, gazed into each other’s eyes earnestly
for a moment, and then sat down on the side of the bed
together in silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old skipper at length spoke:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Roland, my dear, dear boy, how is this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is—what?” inquired the young man, slowly,
and after a pause, speaking in a tone of pain in his hesitating
voice, and with a look of pain in his haggard eyes
that could not be concealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you know. Dear lad, you know! You know
what I mean! How is that I find you here a prisoner,
instead of a free man? Why did you not tell Le that you
were a captive among the pirates, not a confederate of
them? Le could have corroborated your story and you
would have been brought home in honor, not in this
way!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Le could have done nothing for me, under the circumstances!”
replied the young man, in a tone so full
of despair that the old skipper looked at him in horror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Circumstances, Roland? What circumstances? That
devil, Silver, told me he had persuaded you to join his
band. But he never told the truth! Surely, surely,
Roland, he never told the truth! You never joined the
pirate crew! Why do I ask? Of course you never did,
and never could!” said the captain, speaking with great
assurance, but—looking anxiously into the face of his
favorite for confirmation of his words.</p>

<p class='c007'>No such confirmation came.</p>

<p class='c007'>Roland put up his hand and covered his eyes; he
could not bear to meet that anxious, eager gaze of his
old friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Roland, my dear lad, to what circumstances do you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>allude? Roland, for my sake—for all our sakes—for—for—little
Rosemary’s sake, explain yourself!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man kept his eyes covered and his head
bowed, while his whole frame shook as with an ague fit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old skipper saw the effect of his words, and repeated
them:</p>

<p class='c007'>“For little Rosemary’s sake, dear lad!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t! don’t!” wailed Roland. “Don’t! don’t! I
loved the child! Heaven knows how I loved her! She
was always the dearest creature on earth to me! I loved
her so much that I hope, in these three years of absence,
in which she has grown from childhood to womanhood, I
hope she has forgotten me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>These last words were uttered in a wail of anguish.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But she has not forgotten you, Roland! You are the
larger part of her life! From the time I met her on the
<em>Asia</em>——Did I tell you that I came over on the same
ship with Force and his party?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. Capt. Silver told me that he had set you ashore
on the coast of England, not far from Penzance, and so
I supposed that you had come home; but I did not know
on what ship or in what company! Go on! you were
talking about Rosemary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We met by chance on board the <em>Asia</em>. Of course,
there was great surprise on both sides. And, of course,
I told them all about the capture of the <em>Kitty</em> by the pirates.
And the first question my niece asked was about
you. And from this she has been in a state of continual
anxiety about you—anxiety that has been much increased
since she learned of the capture of the <em>Argente</em>
by the <em>Eagle</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You told her I was with the pirates?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As a captive, yes! as a well-treated captive! I was
not likely to repeat to her a tale that I did not myself
believe, about your having joined the crew,” said the
captain, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Roland again covered his face with his hands, and
bowed his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boy I what am I to think of your silence?” demanded
the old skipper, more in sorrow than in anger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my dear old captain, you will think as well of me
as you can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you Capt. Silver’s mate? Yes or no?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot tell you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Roland, if you were the pirate’s mate, you would be
brave enough to avow it. If you were not, you would be
sure to deny it. I do not understand your silence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man did not attempt to explain, but sat
with his elbows on his knees and his head bowed upon
his hands, in an attitude of despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will ask you one other question. Perhaps you will
answer it. Did you recognize in the pirate Silver the
man whom you once knew as Angus Anglesea?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I recognized him,” replied Roland, wearily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he recognized you as the youth he was accustomed
to see with the Forces?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, he knew me at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must have been a strange meeting between you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me all about it, Roland, my lad. What did you
say to him? What did he say to you when you first met?
How did he account for having two characters and two
names, eh? Tell me all about it, lad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot. Believe me, I cannot. Oh, my old captain!
My dear old captain! It wrings my heart to refuse
you! I would do anything to please you, but I
cannot do this which you ask.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t understand! I don’t understand! I don’t
believe I shall ever understand!” exclaimed the perplexed
captain, shaking his gray head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you never will in this world, but I hope that
you will in the world to come, when the secrets of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>hearts shall be revealed. In the meantime—oh, judge
me as charitably as you can!” pleaded Roland.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heaven knows that I wish to do so, my dear lad! Perhaps
you may answer me one more question—a last one:
Why did you drop your lawful name of ‘Roland Bayard,’
and take another by which you are now known—‘Craven
Cloud?’ You need not answer if you do not
choose?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will tell you. The life of a blockade runner——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Blockade runner be blowed!” angrily exclaimed the
old skipper. “Pirate, you mean! You can’t blind me
with—blockade runner! Not after her taking the <em>Kitty</em>,
you can’t! Pirate, lad—pirate!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just as you please! The life, I say, on such a ship
is uncertain; death often tragic. I did not wish to carry
an honest name through such a life, or to such a death.
In a word—if those who loved me were destined to hear
one Craven Cloud—blockade runner, pirate, slaver, as
you please—had been taken and hanged, I did not wish
them to know that I was the man. I took an alias, and
I made it Craven Cloud because the name suited the
case. There! that is all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Roland, you are no pirate—no slaver. It is impossible
that you should be!” exclaimed the old skipper
with the utmost confidence, yet still eagerly, prayerfully
gazing into the troubled face of his young mate
for confirmation of those words.</p>

<p class='c007'>But still no such confirmation came.</p>

<p class='c007'>The door opened and a soldier entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sorry,” he said, in a serio-comic spirit in which some
of the soldiers jested their cares away, “sorry to separate
you, but the best of friends must part. Shutting up time
has come, and the word is march!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean I must go?” inquired the old skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s about the measure of it, granddad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by, Roland, lad! Mind, I don’t believe any ill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>of you, in spite of all. I shall come to see you again to-morrow,
and bring Rosemary with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! no! no! no! Do not bring her! I am parted
from Rosemary forever! The sight of her—would unman
me!” cried the youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then—what am I to say to her when I see her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say—the best you can—the fairest, the most merciful
you can!” exclaimed Roland.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old skipper wrung the youth’s hand and left the
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>He returned to the hotel, but kept entirely out of the
way of the Forces. He had not the courage to meet
Rosemary.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVII<br> <span class='c005'>ON BOARD THE PRIZE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Soon after dinner the earl and the squire left the hotel
for the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>They took a street car that ran from Georgetown to
the navy yard gate.</p>

<p class='c007'>There they alighted and entered the yard, passed the
officers’ quarters, passed the workshops and the ship
house and went down to the water side.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they neared it they saw an officer in naval uniform
standing with his back toward them, and his gaze directed
toward a boat, rowed by six men, that was swiftly
coming toward the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force quickened his steps and laid his hand on
the arm of the man, whom he had recognized as Le.</p>

<p class='c007'>The latter turned quickly, started joyfully, and held
out both hands, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle Abel!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“Le, dear boy!” cried the squire, seizing the youth’s
hands and shaking them cordially.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You here! What a surprise! How glad I am to see
you! I thought you were in Europe. When did you return?
How are my aunt and cousins? And how is Odalite?
And——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Softly, Le. Softly, dear lad. One thing at a time.
We have just arrived from Europe, and we are all well.
And here is a friend of yours whom you are forgetting,”
said the squire, taking the young man’s arm and leading
him back to where the earl stood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord Enderby! How glad I am to see you! This is
another joyful surprise. You are looking so well, too.
Quite recovered your health, I hope,” said Le, cordially
shaking the hand the earl had given him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quite recovered, thank you,” replied the latter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are you stopping, Uncle Abel?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are stopping at the old place where we boarded
six years ago, when we first came to Washington. And
we have been following you about for the last twenty-four
hours,” replied Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And to think I have passed that hotel at least a dozen
times within a day without knowing that you were there!
What a surprise! And you say Odalite is quite well?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Odalite and all are quite well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am so glad to hear that! And to know that they
are all so near! When can I see them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As soon as you please. It will depend on yourself.
They have been waiting for twenty-four hours most
anxiously to see you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a surprise! I cannot get over the surprise.
There is the boat, Uncle Abel. Will you and Lord Enderby
return with me on board the ship, and spend a
few hours with me in the cabin, where we can talk” Le
inquired, as the boat touched the wharf and the rowers
laid on their oars.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“We came down here for that very purpose,” replied
the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, then.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The three gentlemen walked down to the water’s edge
and entered the boat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sailors pushed off, turned and headed for the
<em>Argente</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a pretty view. The sun had just set, and the
western sky was aflame with the crimson afterglow
which was reflected in the water. The full moon was rising
like a vast globe of gold above the gray eastern
horizon. In the distance before them was the green and
wooded shore of Maryland. Midway of the river lay the
<em>Argente</em> at anchor, reflected clearly and duplicated distinctly
in the water below.</p>

<p class='c007'>They soon reached the ship and stood upon the deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>A young midshipman saluted his superior officer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Le introduced him as Midshipman Franklin, exchanged
a few words with him, and then took his friends
down into his own cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was quite a luxuriously furnished place for the
cabin of a man-of-war, as the pirate ship seemed in a
small way to be. An Axminster carpet was on the floor,
and blue satin damask curtains before the berths; blue
satin damask coverings on the chairs and sofas. A
marble-topped round table stood in the center. A marble-topped
sideboard, with silver stands for decanters
and glasses, stood at the end opposite the companion way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Le drew chairs around the table and invited his friends
to be seated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he went to the sideboard and brought forth a
bottle of old port wine, with wineglasses, and a box of
choice Havana cigars, with wax tapers, and putting
them on the table, exclaimed, for the fourth time:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a surprise! I shall never get over this surprise!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“You talk of surprises, Le!” said Mr. Force, when
they had all had a glass of wine around, and had lighted
their cigars. “You talk of surprises; but you ought to
have grown hardened to them by this time! No one could
ever have had a greater one than you had when you
found in the pirate captain and his mate your old enemy,
Angus Anglesea, and your old friend, Roland Bayard!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may well say that, uncle! But I do believe it
was the sight of my old foe that put the devil in me that
day and made me utterly reckless of my life in that
fight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have all read of your heroism in action, Le, my
dear boy, and we are proud of you,” said the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It wasn’t heroism, uncle! It was diabolism! If ever
the devil got into mortal man he did into me that day!
And it was all at the sight of Anglesea.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No matter, the papers are full of the brilliant action,
and you are the hero of the hour.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of the hour. You are right, uncle! Of the hour!
In these days of heroes—on both sides, mind, uncle—no
one man, whatever his deeds, could expect to hold
public attention for a longer time. But, indeed—and
there is no mock modesty in what I say—I have no
merit. I was more mad than brave in that action.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your captain, in his dispatches to the department,
puts the case in a better light. But let that pass for
the present. Do you know who the pirate really is?” demanded
the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No more than that he is Capt. Silver, known to us as
Col. Anglesea,” said Le.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is neither entitled to the one name nor the other.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Neither Silver nor Anglesea? Who is he, then?”
demanded the young commander, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Enderby, dear fellow! You, who can speak with
authority, tell Leonidas who the man really is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl, thus entreated, turned to the young officer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>and told him the story of Byrne Stukely, as it is already
known to our readers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Le listened with the closest attention, and at the close
of the narrative drew a deep sigh of relief and breathed
forth a fervent thanksgiving.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so you see by what Enderby has told you, that
the rascal has not now, nor ever has had, the slightest
claim on the hand of Odalite, who is now, and always has
been, perfectly free. There is not even any need to seek
the aid of the law in her case,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven! Oh! thank Heaven!” again fervently
exclaimed Le.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, after a pause, he asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle, when can I see Odalite?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As soon as you please, my boy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish I could see her to-night But to-night duty
holds me here. Franklin, my second in command, has
gone on shore for the first time to see his family, who
reside here, and whom he has not seen for three years.
So I cannot get off to-night! But early to-morrow!
How early may I see her to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come and breakfast with us at nine to-morrow. That
is about as early as we can manage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will go!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now, Le, tell us about Roland Bayard. How
comes it that he is in the uniform of the pirate’s mate?
How comes it that he is brought here as a prisoner, instead
of as a rescued captive?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The countenance of the young man fell, all the joyous
life died out of it, and he murmured:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had forgotten! In my own selfish joy I had forgotten,’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forgotten? What, Le?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had forgotten Roland’s position. Oh, Uncle Abel!
It is a most cruel one!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Tell me one thing,” sternly demanded Mr. Force.
“Was he Silver’s mate?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do not know, Le? What do you mean by that?
Surely you must know!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed, I do not, uncle. After the fight was over,
and when the two prisoners were placed under my charge
on board this ship, and she was manned by a part of the
crew from the <em>Eagle</em>, and I was ordered to take her
home, when we had set sail and were well on our way I
went to see Roland, to ask him some explanation of his
presence on board the blockade runner. He was not
known there as Roland Bayard, but as Craven Cloud.
I found him alone, for the two prisoners had been confined
separately. I found him moody to the verge of
melancholy madness. I told him how grieved I was to
find him there, and asked him to tell me how it happened,
when he had left Capt. Grandiere, whether he
had joined the navy and had been captured in some
action.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what did he reply to all these questions?” inquired
Mr. Force, seeing that Le paused in his narrative.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not one satisfactory word! He told me that fate
had brought him there, and that he could tell me no
more. And though I plied him with questions, and appealed
to him to answer them in the name of our lifelong
love for one another, he remained obdurate. He assured
me that he could not satisfy me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he never did?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He never did. But one day he told me the reason
why his tongue was tied.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what was that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a terrible revelation, uncle—a terrible revelation!
But it accounted for everything that was strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>in Roland’s life and conduct,” replied Le, still shrinking
from the utterance of what he had to say.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, well, my boy?” demanded the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He told me that Capt. Silver was his own father!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good Heaven!” exclaimed the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>The squire was silent for a moment, and then said, in
the most emphatic manner:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t believe it! It is not true!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! sir, it was true—too true! He had every proof
of its truth! Therefore, you understand that poor Roland,
if he was a prisoner among the blockade runners
and a witness to deeds even more unlawful and more
criminal, could not open his mouth with explanations
that might be fatal to Capt. Silver.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The scoundrel is no more Roland’s father than I am!
No, not by an infinite distance, for I have been a father
to the boy ever since he was a baby. And I know that
scoundrel is nothing to him! I know the reason why he
told such a falsehood to the young man. It was to get
him into his power and seal his lips! Did Roland, for
instance, tell you how he came to be separated from
Capt. Grandiere, and to be on board the blockade runner,
or rather the pirate, as she really was?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir. I explained to you that he would tell me
nothing but that fate had brought him there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course. Then I will tell you. Capt. Grandiere’s
ship, the <em>Kitty</em>, was taken by the pirate <em>Argente</em> about
six weeks since only. Her crew were put into open boats
and sent adrift to sink or swim, find land or perish, as
fate might will. Her two officers, Skipper Grandiere and
Mate Bayard, were taken prisoners, and brought on
board the <em>Argente</em>, while a part of the pirate crew were
sent on board the <em>Kitty</em>, to take her, with her rich cargo,
to some port—Heaven knows where! That is how
young Bayard came on board the pirate ship.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is—it—possible!” exclaimed Le, in amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“Yes; and from the time the master and mate of the
<em>Kitty</em> were captured by Silver they were never allowed
to meet. Roland, who had been wounded, was kept
below in the cockpit. Silver told Capt. Grandiere that
Bayard had decided to take service with him, and did not
wish to see his old captain for fear of unpleasant words.
Silver was near the English coast, and he sent a boat
ashore at night and landed the old skipper on a remote
beach in Cornwall, and left him to find his way to London
as best he might.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how did you find out all this, Uncle Abel?” inquired
Le, unable to get over his amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Grandiere went up to London on a third-class train,
found his correspondents, told his story, got what money
he wanted, and engaged passage on the <em>Asia</em> from Liverpool
to New York. We came over on the same steamer.
That is how we came to know it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is Capt. Grandiere now?” inquired Le.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In Washington, staying at the same hotel with us.
You may judge our surprise, and his triumph, when on
reaching New York, three days since, we learned that
the blockade runner <em>Argente</em> had been captured by the
United States man-of-war <em>Eagle</em>, and had been sent home
as a prize, under the command of Lieut. Force. We
came down to Washington by the first train—I and my
party—to see you and Roland; but Capt. Grandiere
avowedly to prove Silver to be a pirate, and to hang
him. Capt. Grandiere will now also be able to prove
that young Roland Bayard was captured by the pirates
at the same time that his ship, the <em>Kitty</em>, was taken, and
he, the skipper, taken prisoner. Capt. Grandiere’s evidence
must vindicate Roland Bayard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! if it only could! But, uncle, if Roland will not
deny that he was a voluntary member of the pirate
crew?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“He will deny it, when he knows the pirate lied to him
and deceived him, and has no claim whatever to his forbearance,
much less to his duty or affection,” said Mr.
Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was growing late, and Mr. Force arose to go.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle,” said Le, “why cannot you and the earl stay
on board with me to-night? I can send a man with a
note to the hotel to let the ladies know where you are,
and I can make you up most comfortable berths in this
cabin. And to-morrow we can all three go and breakfast
with our friends,” pleaded the young man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Le, my lad, I should like it extremely, but I cannot
speak for Enderby,” replied the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I propose this,” said the earl—“that I return to the
hotel to take care of the ladies, and prepare them for
your reception in the morning, leaving you here, Force,
with your nephew.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl’s proposal was accepted by acclamation, and
soon after he took his leave, and was rowed ashore, leaving
the uncle and nephew to spend the night together on
the ship.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVIII<br> <span class='c005'>A TERRIBLE REVELATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“We must wait until Franklin comes on board,” said
Leonidas Force, the next morning, as he stood beside Mr.
Force, on the deck of the <em>Argente</em>, looking off toward the
navy yard, where a boat had already been sent to bring
out the young midshipman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will he be punctual?” inquired Mr. Force, who was
almost as impatient as his companion to be off to keep
their appointment to breakfast with the ladies of their
family at the hotel that morning.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“‘Punctual!’” echoed Le. “His orders are to report
on board at seven this morning, and he will be here on
time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force took out his watch and looked at it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It wants twelve minutes to seven now!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And here comes Franklin!” replied Le, as the young
midshipman was seen running across the yard down to
the water’s edge, where the boat waited.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he jumped on board, the boat was seen to turn and
head for the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few minutes it had crossed the water and come
up alongside.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Franklin sprang out and climbed up on deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two minutes to seven! You are prompt, midshipman,”
said Le, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would rather be an hour too soon than a second too
late, lieutenant,” replied the young officer, saluting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quite right! Tell the coxswain to wait. He is to
take this gentleman and myself ashore,” said Le.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he went down into his cabin, followed by Mr.
Force, to make a few final preparations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon they returned to the deck, went down into the
boat, and headed for the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they landed, and were walking across the yard,
Le asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I may at last marry Odalite without let or hindrance?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have told you so, lad!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, bless you, uncle! But how soon? How soon?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This very day, if Odalite and her mother agree.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us walk faster, uncle! Please!” pleaded the impatient
lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear Le! Consider—consider my rheumatism!
Besides, look! There is no car near the gate, and we
shall pass through before one comes up.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Le saw at once that fast walking would not bring him
any sooner to the side of his sweetheart, and so he moderated
his haste.</p>

<p class='c007'>They reached the gate just as a car came up, and they
entered it while the horses were being unharnessed and
turned around.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If one had but wings!” said Le.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would find them inconvenient on most occasions,”
replied Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several other passengers now entered the car, and it
started on its uptown trip.</p>

<p class='c007'>Passengers from the sidewalks, however, continued to
stop the car and crowd in until it was more than full,
for every seat was occupied, and all the standing room
between the rows, as well as both platforms before and
behind.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was always the condition of the street cars in war
times, when authorities were as careless of the lives of
horses as they were of those of men.</p>

<p class='c007'>All private conversation was rendered impossible, and
Mr. Force rode on in perfect silence, half suffocated by
the close air and heavily pressed upon by a crowd of men
standing up in the middle, hanging on by the straps and
swaying to and fro against the forms of their fellow passengers.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last—“long last”—the ordeal was over. The toiling
horses reached the corner of the street on which their
hotel was situated, and Mr. Force pulled the strap to stop
the car, and with his companion slowly pushed, elbowed
and worked his way out of the “black hole” in the open
air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is one comfort in this difficulty in getting out—though
our clothes are often torn and our flesh
scratched or bruised in the trial—yet it gives the
wretched horses a minute’s rest,” said the squire, as, followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>by Le, he made his way across the pavement to the
ladies’ entrance of the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here a great shock met him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl, pale and grave, stood in the hall waiting for
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He bowed to Le, and then took the arm of his brother-in-law,
and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come with me, Force—lieutenant, you will find the
young ladies in the parlor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Le, surprised and vaguely uneasy, hesitated for a moment,
and then ran upstairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the meaning of this, Enderby? What has
happened?” anxiously inquired the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your wife is not well. She——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is ill! She is dangerously ill! Let me go to her!
Let me go to her at once!” exclaimed the terrified husband,
breaking from the earl’s hold.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no, I beg of you! It would be useless! She is—sleeping!
Two physicians and a nurse watch beside her,
and they forbid all approach for the present. Come in
here with me!” said the earl, drawing his brother-in-law
into the nearest room, which happened to be a temporarily
untenanted private parlor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When did this happen? Why was I not sent for at
once? What is the nature of her illness? Oh, my dear
wife!” exclaimed the squire, as he fell rather than sat
down upon the nearest chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl closed the door and turned the key, and
then answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not an hour ago! They—Elfrida and her daughter,
with Miss Hedge and myself—were in the drawing room
waiting for your arrival before ordering breakfast. A
servant brought in the morning paper, and Wynnette
took it to read aloud for the benefit of the party. She
turned first to the report of the examination of the two
prisoners, Silver and Cloud, alias Stukely and Bayard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>and of the demand of the British Government for their
extradition upon charge of piracy and slave dealing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The demand was said to have come through the British
consul at New York, who had been on the watch for
the possible capture by our ships of this same pirate
ship.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then old Grandiere’s word will come true!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Probably! But as Wynnette read I happened to look
at my sister. She had grown deadly pale. I arose to go
to her, but she raised her hand with a gesture of command
that stopped me, and she listened to the end of
the reading, and then, with her wonderful self-control—deadly
pale as she was—arose to leave the room. Wynnette
had not observed the change in her mother; but
Odalite and Elva had done so, and both of them sprang
to her side. Her attack was so sudden and unaccountable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I understand! I understand!” muttered Mr. Force
to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But she waved the girls back in the most peremptory
manner, and went alone to her room. The children
came back to me, and gazed in my face for an explanation.
I could give them none. They once more started
to follow their mother. But I called them back, and told
them to be patient. Then the condition of little Rosemary
Hedge claimed attention. She was sobbing violently
on the sofa. I told my nieces to respect their
mother’s wish to be left alone; that she was probably
overcome by the ill news of one whom she had known
from his boyhood, and that she would best recover her
composure in solitude.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I understand! I understand!” again murmured the
poor squire to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I went to Rosemary, and sought to soothe her. While
I was so engaged little Elva slipped away and went up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>to her mother’s room, and instantly came shrieking back,
telling us, in wild and incoherent exclamations, that her
mother lay unconscious on the floor of her chamber.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gracious! Gracious heavens!” groaned the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We hurried to her assistance, all of us, even Rosemary,
who forgot her own grief at this crisis. We found
her on the carpet in a deep swoon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She lay face downward, and dressed as if for a journey.
By her side lay a traveling bag, which seemed to
have dropped from her hand as she fell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I understand! Oh, I understand too well! too well!”
muttered the squire to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We got her on the bed, and sent for a doctor. There
was one in the house, who heard of the event, and came
first. Then the doctor whom we had sent for arrived.
They are with her now. One of them procured a professional
nurse. And they are all three agreed upon one
point—that no one but the doctor or nurse be allowed to
enter the room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I must go to her door. I will not make the least
noise; but I must go to the door and see one of the physicians,”
said Mr. Force, rising.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will go with you,” said the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two gentlemen left the room together, and went
up two flights of stairs to the floor on which was the suit
of rooms occupied by the Forces.</p>

<p class='c007'>They paused before the door of the chamber of illness,
or it might be of death, and Mr. Force tapped very
gently.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the nurse, a wholesome-looking, middle-aged
woman, who answered the summons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish to see one of the physicians,” whispered Abel
Force, in a voice that trembled with emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman stepped noiselessly back into the room,
and was presently succeeded by Dr. Bolten, a large, fair,
bald-headed man, of about sixty years of age. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>stepped out into the passage noiselessly, closing the door
behind him. Then, in a whisper, he greeted Mr. Force,
with whom he had been acquainted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is my wife?” he inquired, in breathless anxiety.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIX<br> <span class='c005'>THE BITTERNESS OF DEATH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The doctor took the squire’s arm and led him away
from the door before he answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is doing as well as possible under the circumstances.
All depends now on absolute quiet. It was for
that reason I summoned a trained nurse and forbid any
of the family to approach her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what is the nature of her illness, doctor?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has received a severe mental shock.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of what nature?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will—will she—recover?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With great care, I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can I go in—very quietly—and look upon her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not if you speak to her. Not if you waken her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will neither speak to her nor waken her. You
shall see how noiseless I can be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not going back to her room. I have all my
patients to see yet, but I will call again in the afternoon.
Dr. Hollis will remain a little longer. And the nurse,
Mrs. Winder, can be relied on. If you enter the room,
Mr. Force, let me entreat you to make no sound,” said
Dr. Bolton, bowing, and passing the squire on his way
downstairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force softly turned the handle of the lock, which
had been oiled, and entered the room.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>On the bed, covered with a white counterpane up to
her chin, lay the form of his fair wife, still and white
as death. On one side of her sat the nurse; on the other
side stood the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force raised his finger in token that he did not
mean to speak, nor expect to be spoken to, and so he approached
the bed on tiptoe, and gazed upon the marble
features, colorless except for the dark rings around the
eyes and lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the husband gazed a spasm of anguish convulsed
his features. He turned his eyes from the face of his
wife to that of the young doctor who stood over her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Hollis smiled and placed his finger on his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abel Force understood both signs, and felt a little
hope steal into his heart. He stood for some time longer
gazing upon the beloved face, and then, at another sign
from the doctor, he turned to steal noiselessly from the
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he went from the bedside toward the door his eyes
fell on a large packet of paper, with a note tied on the
top of it. And as he passed he took it up, thinking that
it might be something that required to be sent to the post
office.</p>

<p class='c007'>After leaving the room and closing the door softly behind
him, he looked at the superscription of the packet.
And it was this:</p>

<p class='c008'>“To my dear husband, Abel Force. To be opened by
him alone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The packet was sealed and tied with a cord, under
which was slipped a letter, directed simply to Abel
Force, Esq.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Mr. Force had looked at this packet he showed
neither surprise at its existence or impatience to read it.
Without breaking the seal, he slipped it into his pocket,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and went quietly down to the parlor in search of his
troubled young people.</p>

<p class='c007'>He found them all seated as if they had been at a
funeral.</p>

<p class='c007'>Odalite and Le occupied one of the small sofas. Old
Capt. Grandiere sat in a large armchair, with his little
niece, Rosemary, on his knees, her head on his shoulder
and her arms around his neck. She had sobbed herself
into exhaustion, and therefore into quietness, and was
listening calmly to the consolation the old skipper was
trying to give her, and which was something like this:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tell you, my pet, he may be as stubborn as a mule,
and hold his tongue until he loses the use of it, but I
know that, not two months since, he was taken prisoner
off my ship, along with me and all the crew, and so far
from being the pirate’s mate, he was the pirate’s prisoner.
I’ll tell my own story, and it will clear Roland
as sure as it will hang Silver.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This, in every form and variety of language, was the
oft-repeated consolation that the old skipper was offering
to his little niece, and not without effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elva and Wynnette were seated with the earl, who
was talking to them in a low voice, and evidently trying
to keep up their spirits.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the squire entered the room his daughters
all hurried to meet him, with anxious looks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dears,” he said, “the doctors speak hopefully of
your mother’s condition. Let us be patient and trust in
Providence; and for the present, my children, you must
control your feelings and keep away from her room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But this did not satisfy the daughters of Elfrida Force.
They plied their father with questions:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the matter with mamma?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did the doctors tell you what ails her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When will she get well?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How soon may we see her?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>And so forth, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force answered these questions as well as he was
able, but not at all satisfactorily.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old skipper broke in upon their talk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Force! I wish to the Lord you would order these
girls down to breakfast! Here it is ten o’clock and not
one of us has had a mouthful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dears, is that true?” demanded their father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, we could not touch any food so long as we felt
so anxious about dear mamma!” answered Odalite, for
the whole party.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come down at once! Le, give Odalite your arm!
Grandiere, take care of Rosemary! Enderby, look after
Wynnette! Come, my little Elva, under my own wing,”
said the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so the party of eight went down to the public
breakfast room, but in truth no one but the earl, the old
skipper, and the young lieutenant made any pretense of
eating. The husband and daughters of Elfrida Force
could not feed while the life of the wife and mother
was in jeopardy. But they drank some strong coffee,
which served to support their strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>After breakfast the young girls returned to the drawing
room under the escort of the earl and the old captain;
but Le remained by the side of Abel Force, who
walked toward the office of the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The occupant of the little room adjoining our own
has left this morning, and I wish to engage the apartment
before any one else takes it; for, Le, if the doctors
will not allow me to remain in the same apartment with
my suffering wife, I must, at least, be in the next one, if
possible,” said Mr. Force, as he went up to the counter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The room was secured, and the two men turned to go
upstairs together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle,” said Le, “Odalite will not give me any answer!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Will not fix a day for our marriage until her
mother recovers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Odalite is right, Le! How can she think of marriage,
or of anything but her mother at this crisis?” solemnly
inquired Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, uncle, we have been so often disappointed, so
often put off! It does seem as if fate were against us!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t be selfish, Le! Think, my dear boy, what anxiety
we are all suffering just now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it, uncle! I know it, and I share it! But
how could our marriage affect the present circumstances?
It could not increase the danger of my aunt, nor could it
heighten our anxiety,” pleaded the youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear Le, your passion blinds you to the fact that
your marriage at this time would be deeply indecorous!
Say no more about it, dear lad, until our beloved sufferer
is out of danger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Le sighed profoundly, but did not answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Le,” said the squire, in a low voice, to change the
subject, “have you told old Grandiere why it is that Roland
will not give evidence against the pirate captain,
even to save himself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I have told him that Roland has been persuaded
by Silver, that he, Silver, is his, Roland’s, father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He said that he didn’t believe one word of it. He
said that when the villain was down in Maryland he must
have heard the story of the young man having been
saved in his infancy from the wreck of the <em>Carrier Pigeon</em>,
without a mark on person or clothing to point to his
parentage, and taken advantage of the circumstance to
claim Roland as his son, and get him in his power.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think Grandiere was right,” said Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they reentered the parlor they found all their
party present, idle and silent, because, in fact, they could
settle themselves to neither occupation nor conversation
while their minds were so full of anxiety.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Le went and sat down beside Odalite.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force lingered a few moments in the room to bid
his troubled daughters to trust in Providence and hope
for the best. Then, telling them he was going up to sit
in the room he had engaged adjoining their mother’s, and
that he might be found there if wanted, he left the parlor
and went upstairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>First he stopped at the door of the side room and
tapped lightly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nurse came to answer the summons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is she?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nurse came out and softly closed the door behind
her before answering:</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is sleeping quietly, and must not be disturbed on
any account.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you. That will do. I am going to sit in the
next room. If I should be wanted, come to me there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir,” said the woman, returning noiselessly to
the sick chamber, and closing the door behind her.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Mr. Force turned away, his eyes fell upon the form
of Rosemary Hedge moving silently as a spirit along the
corridor.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went to her and whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing. I am only going to our room to put on my
hat. Uncle Grandiere is going to take me to see dear
Roland,” replied the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, that is right. God bless you, my dear!” said the
squire, as Rosemary passed on to the large, double-bedded
room in the same corridor which was occupied by
the four girls.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XX<br> <span class='c005'>“WHEN LOVERS MEET IN ADVERSE HOUR”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Rosemary quickly put on the olive green linsey suit in
which she had crossed the sea, and the little round traveling
cap in which she had ridden to the city, and hurried
downstairs to join her uncle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her dress was not too warm for these late April days.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, my little love,” said the old skipper, “I could
not find a carriage for you on the stand, nor even at the
livery stable around the corner; so there is nothing for
us but to pack ourselves into a moving black hole they
call a street car or to walk. I think by walking fast we
could reach Capitol Hill sooner than by riding in one
of these cars.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us walk, by all means,” promptly replied Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then went downstairs together and set out for a brisk
rate down Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a fine morning, with a bright sun, and a deep
blue sky mottled lightly with feathery white clouds, as
became an April day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must keep up your heart, little girl,” said the
old man, as they walked on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do try to do so. I have trust in the Lord; and,
under Him, in you, Uncle Gideon. But oh! when I
think of how the news affected her, my heart almost dies
in my breast,” sighed the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mrs. Force, do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t you see? If the news of Roland’s danger
affected her so greatly, his state must be very serious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, Roland may have had nothing to do with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the lady’s attack. It looks to me as if it was an apoplectic
fit, such as might have happened to any middle-aged
man or woman without any outside cause. Besides,
I never heard of Mrs. Force taking the least interest
in the young man, or even the slightest notice of
him beyond mere civility.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, she did—I am sure she did! I always thought—but
indeed I hardly know why I thought so—that she
was kinder to me on account of Roland. She always
sympathized with me. And it was the news of Roland’s
peril that brought on her illness—I know it was!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you know it, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I was watching her while Wynnette was
reading the paper. I was almost ready to die with my
trouble, and I was looking to her for help and comfort—because
she always sympathized with me—and I saw
her start, and her eyes grow wide and scared, and her
face turn white; and then I saw her rise to leave the
room. And then, but not till then, the others saw her,
and went to her; but she sent them all back. And I
knew it was about Roland, and I thought there was no
hope for him, and I fell to screaming. Oh, uncle, it
was so very bad in me to go on screaming so, but I
couldn’t help it. I couldn’t faint and forget all about it,
like Amanda Fitzallen used to do when she couldn’t
stand things any longer, so I had to keep screaming. If
I hadn’t I do think my heart would have bursted!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was all quite enough to frighten you into hysterics,
my poor little girl, when I was not on hand to reassure
you. But still, my dear, in future you must control
yourself. There is nothing more contemptible in this
world than a man or woman who cannot control himself
or herself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, uncle—my heart would have bursted if I hadn’t
screamed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, my dear, you should have let it burst, rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>than have screamed. This may seem harsh to you, my
dear, but it is the best kindness. Self-control, my little
girl, is one of the mightiest powers in this world. It is
the soul of the ruler, my dear,” said the old skipper;
and having taken this text he preached on it until they
reached the foot of the Capitol Hill, and he lost his wind
in climbing up it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a short time they reached the Old Capitol prison.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. Grandiere had procured two passes, and armed
with these, presented himself and his niece at the
guarded door, and was permitted to enter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know the way now! But let me take a long breath
before I begin to climb all these stairs that are before
us!” said the old man, as he dropped upon a rude bench
in the hall and began to wipe his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rosemary sat down beside him, and peeped charily
through her green veil at the sentries that stood before
the closed doors on each side the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently the captain arose and told Rosemary to
come along, and began to ascend the stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>They went up three flights and found themselves on
the third floor of the building, in a wide passage, with
closed doors, guarded by sentries on each side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walking between these they reached the front end of
the hall, where a small apartment had been made across
it by a partition of wood. Before a rude door a sentry
stood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. Grandiere showed his permits, and the soldier
opened the door to let them pass.</p>

<p class='c007'>They entered the small room, which, however, had
the advantage of a large window and of perfect cleanliness—of
almost aggressive cleanliness—for everything
smelt of fresh water and fresh whitewash.</p>

<p class='c007'>Roland Bayard sat on the side of his narrow cot, engaged
in reading the morning paper.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>As his visitors entered the place he looked up, and
gave a cry of mingled pleasure and reproach.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle! Rosemary! Oh, Rosemary! Oh, uncle,
how could you? Why did you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Roland! Dear Roland! I couldn’t help it! I
wanted to see you so much! Oh, Roland, you are glad
to see me, are you not?” pleaded Rosemary, going to
him and putting both her hands on his shoulders, with
all the innocent candor of her childhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Glad’ to see you? ‘Glad!’” echoed the young man,
in a broken voice, as he took her tiny hands and pressed
them to his heart and to his lips, while his hot tears fell
upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rosemary burst into a storm of tears and wept upon
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, uncle!” reproachfully exclaimed Roland, “why
did you bring this child here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because no power on earth would have kept her
away! If I had not brought her, she would have done
some deadly thing! She would have gone and got a pass
for herself. She would have come here alone and exposed
herself to insult on the way! You don’t know
what desperate dare-devils these little blue-eyed angels
of our race can be, where their friends are in danger
or in trouble!” said the old man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, oh! it is not only that I wanted to see you,”
said Rosemary, raising her tearful face from his shoulder,
“but I wanted to beg you for my sake—for my sake,
Roland, to be just to yourself! To have mercy on yourself!
You know, as we know, that you are not a pirate
or a slave-stealer! You know, as we know, that you
were taken prisoner by the pirates when the <em>Kitty</em> was
captured! Capt. Grandiere can testify to that! But he
cannot swear that you never joined the pirate crew after
you became their prisoner! He cannot swear that you
never became the pirate captain’s mate, as they charge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>you with being. Only you can tell what you did after
recovering from your wounds on board the pirate ship.
We know that you remained true to yourself and to your
friends and to every principle of manhood and honesty,
and we could swear that you did, from our lifelong
knowledge of you! But, oh, Roland! But, oh, Roland!
Such testimony would not be worth anything
in a court of law, where moral conviction is not legal
evidence! Oh, dear, dear Roland! Take pity on yourself
and on us, and testify to the facts that will vindicate
you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>These were her words, but no pen can give the pleading,
prayerful, pathetic tones and looks and gestures
with which they were uttered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole strong frame of the young man shook with
the emotion that convulsed his soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rosemary!” he said, at length, in a broken voice, “I
am about to speak the words that must separate us forever.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He paused, and she took up his cue.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That you cannot do, Roland! Neither man nor
angel can utter words which would separate us forever.
In this world we may be parted, Roland, if such be your
will. But not forever! Not forever!” she said, in her
tender, vibrating tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rosemary, hear me! I cannot give the testimony
that would vindicate myself, because the same testimony
would convict Capt. Silver.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He will be convicted fast enough without your testimony,”
put in the old skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then it would help to convict him, so I must not
give it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, oh! Roland, why should you care for that
wicked man—that wickedest man in the whole world?”
pleaded Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“Because, poor child—and now come the words that
must part us—because I am his son!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rosemary stared in blank amazement, while she grew
pale as ashes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are no more his son than you are my son! And
not half so much as you are Abel Force’s son! Deuce
take you, lad, are you such a baby as to be beguiled by
that man’s lies? He found out your early history, and
has made use of the facts, as well as of the want of facts,
to deceive you and claim you as his son, to get you in his
power, to make you his comrade, if he could, and to tie
your tongue in any case. Ah! you must be a blind bat,
indeed, not to see through him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! Capt. Grandiere, old friend, you do not know!
You do not know! Capt. Silver has proved the truth of
his story to me,” replied Roland, in a tone of despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How has he proved this?” demanded the old skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dare not tell you that. His story involves the—the—honor
of another—of another family. I cannot
breathe another word on this subject beyond the bare
fact that I know myself to be Silver’s son, and will not
give testimony to convict my father. So much was due
to you, and told that you may know why I will not
testify.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then——!——!——!” The old skipper let off a
volley of oaths that might have been highly effectual in a
storm at sea, or a fight with pirates, but that fell on
Rosemary’s delicate ears like claps of thunder, and made
her put her hands up to shelter them—and he finished
by saying—“If I don’t give a hint to the authorities and
have you put upon the stand and compelled to give evidence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man made no reply, but turning to Rosemary,
began to ask about their mutual friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl answered all his questions to the best of her
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>This conversation lasted until the old skipper arose
to take leave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain,” said Roland, “my advice to you is to take
Rosemary down to Maryland and leave her there with
her friends. Washington, under present circumstances,
is certainly no place for the child.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will not go, Roland. I will not stir from this city
until I see you through this trouble!” said the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You hear that?” inquired the old skipper. “And
you see that I could not get her away without turning
Turk and tyrant, and calling in the power of the law and
using force and violence to back up that. What can an
old ruffian like me, even though I weigh two hundred
pounds, and am the terror of the roughest crew afloat,
do with a mite of a blue-eyed angel? She’ll do as she
likes, if she dies for it!” growled the skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will let me come to see you every day, Roland,
and in that way I can try to bear this,” pleaded Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“May the Lord bless you, my child. May the Lord
bless you and keep you safe always!” breathed Roland,
as he folded her to his heart and kissed her—even as he
had been accustomed to do when he was a little lad and
she was a baby.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so the interview ended.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXI<br> <span class='c005'>COUNTRY VISITORS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Capt. Grandiere and Rosemary left the Old Capitol
prison by the way they had entered it, and bent their
steps toward Pennsylvania Avenue, and thence toward
their hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>The old skipper went upstairs with Rosemary, to ask
after Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>They found all the young people of their party still
in the drawing room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force was up another flight of stairs in the room
next to that of his sick wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut. Force had returned to his ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>Odalite, Wynnette and Elva were seated about the
room, trying to work at their flower embroidery and conversing
at intervals in hushed voices.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well! And how is the mother by this time?” cheerily
inquired the captain, with a view to encourage the
daughters.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dr. Bolton has just made a second visit, and says
that she will do well, if not disturbed,” replied Odalite.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven! I hope she will be all right in a
day or two!” exclaimed Grandiere, heartily, as he threw
himself into a big armchair and dropped his hat between
his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you leave Roland?” inquired Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perfectly well, as to his bodily health. He inquired
after you all, and sent his respects to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How does he take his arrest and imprisonment?—that
is what I meant,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bravely and patiently, as should a man with a good
conscience,” replied the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can prove that he was a prisoner among the
pirates, and not a comrade of their crew?” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can swear that he was their prisoner,” replied the
old man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, of course, that will clear him,” said Wynnette,
conclusively.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old skipper did not contradict her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps he might have done so, however, if at that
moment the door had not opened to admit a waiter, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>brought a handful of cards that he held together like an
open fan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before he could deliver them a group of laughing visitors
passed him and entered the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rosemary made a dart at the group, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother! Oh, mother!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was caught in the arms of Mrs. Dorothy Hedge
and covered with tears and kisses, while the three other
girls rushed upon Miss Susannah Grandiere, and the old
skipper trotted across the room and shook hands with
his grandnephew Sam, who was the only member of the
visiting party left for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The words that followed on all sides were at first
rather incoherent, as such greetings after such partings
are apt to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We followed up the fellow who brought up our tickets.
Fancy our staying downstairs to wait for him to go
and come! So as he insisted on taking our tickets first
and handed us blank ones and a pencil, I wrote all our
names down and let him take them, but we followed
close behind the tickets!” said Mr. Sam Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cards, dear Sam! Cards!” whispered Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is it that you are not in the army?” inquired
Capt. Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because somebody had to stay home to plow and sow
and look after the family,” replied the young man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so you never volunteered, and you bought a
substitute when you were drafted?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never volunteered because my father and brother
were both in the army, and because, as I said before,
somebody had to stay home and look after the crops.
And I never was drafted; if I had been I should have
gone in, because I could not have found it in my conscience
to tempt any poor fellow with money to go and
get shot in my place. No, if I had been drafted I should
have gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“Right, my boy! Right! Right! Right!” exclaimed
his uncle, heartily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how are all here?” inquired Miss Susannah
Grandiere, when at length all were seated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see us all here except papa and mamma. Papa
is well, but mamma——” Here the speaker, Odalite,
paused as the tears choked her voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Grandiere looked from one to the other of the
family party in mute, though anxious inquiry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mrs. Force was taken suddenly ill this morning,”
said the old captain, speaking for his friends. “No!
now don’t be alarmed! The doctor, who has just left
her, says that she is doing well, and will be all right if
kept quiet!” he added, to soothe the uneasiness of the
visitors.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what is the matter with her?” inquired Mrs.
Hedge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She had a severe shock, and fell into a swoon. She
has been lying prostrate, but quiet, ever since. Now,
don’t be alarmed; there is no danger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what sort of a shock?” inquired Miss Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Susannah, you were always inquisitor-general. Mrs.
Force heard suddenly that a friend of ours, young Roland
Bayard, had been taken prisoner under exceptional
circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What circumstances?” persisted the inquisitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old skipper heaved a deep sigh, and as briefly as
he could, told the story of Roland’s double capture, first
by the <em>Argente</em>, that took the <em>Kitty</em>, and afterward by
the <em>Eagle</em>, that took the <em>Argente</em>, and he added, without
reserve, the circumstances of Capt. Silver’s alleged claim
upon Roland, which sealed the lips of the latter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Roland the pirate’s son! Why, he is no more Silver’s
son than he is mine!” exclaimed young Sam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, now tell us how it was that you found us so
soon?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“Well,” said Sam, “to begin at the beginning: On
Monday morning we got your telegram saying that you
had all arrived safe, and that Uncle Gideon was along
with you, and you would be with us in a few days.
Naturally we were all rejoiced and we waited for you.
But on Wednesday morning we got the New York papers,
telling all about the capture of the <em>Argente</em> by the
<em>Eagle</em>, and the arrival of the <em>Argente</em> under command of
Lieut. Force, and of the prize being ordered to the navy
yard here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And it did not need one to rise from the dead to
reveal the fact that we should all come directly to this
city to meet Le!” put in Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, it didn’t!” assented Sam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so I offered to come up and see you. And Aunt
Dolly and Aunt Sukey said they would come, too. So I
harnessed the two strongest draft horses to the old carryall,
and we set out yesterday morning. We got as far
as Horsehead last night, and put up there for the night.
This morning we started early, and reached the city
about noon. First, like a fool, I drove my party to your
sometime house at the West End. Found it was all
turned into public offices. Then we went the rounds of
the hotels and now at last we have found you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good boy!” exclaimed Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But have you found rooms?” anxiously inquired the
old skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. Our carryall is at the door. We came here to
call first, but we also hoped that we would be able to
put up here,” said Sam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed, I hope you may,” said the old skipper; “but
the dearest thing in Washington at the present time is
space! If I had a room to myself I would offer it to
these ladies, but I have only a single bed in a double-bedded
room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, at any rate, you will order your carriage around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>to the livery stable and spend the day with us. That will
give Mr. Grandiere time to see about your rooms, here
or elsewhere,” said Odalite to the two elder ladies, who
were seated on the sofa, with Rosemary between them,
with each of her little hands clasped one in each of
theirs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my dear, thank you, we will spend the day,”
announced Mrs. Hedge, for her party.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come up now and lay off your wraps,” said Rosemary,
leading the way to what, in party parlance, was
now called the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle,” inquired Sam Grandiere, very anxiously,
“are matters really serious with Roland Bayard?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So serious, my lad, that I fear for the worst. Unless
he can be disabused of this idea that Silver has impressed
upon him—that he is the pirate’s own son—he
will never be induced to give the testimony that will
convict that pirate and vindicate himself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Miss Sibby Bayard were only here; she might be
of use at this time,” mused Sam, aloud.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Sibby Bayard is here, you bet! Talk of the
devil and you know what follows,” said a voice on the
threshold, and the form of the lady in question appeared
at the door. “When a thing is got to be done, sez I, the
sooner the better, sez I! And so here I am, good folks.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXII<br> <span class='c005'>NEW HOPE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Miss Sibby!” exclaimed the assembled party, in one
breath, as they all arose to welcome her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes!” said the good woman, after she had shaken
hands all around, and had sunk breathless into the nearest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>easy chair. “It is all mighty fine to cry out ‘Miss
Sibby,’ as if you were overjoled at the sight of me; but
deeds speak louder than words, sez I. And them as runs
away to the city and leave me behind, sez I, and then
pretends to be glad to see me, sez I, is nothing but
‘sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal,’ sez I. Yes, it’s
you I mean, Sam Grandiere!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Miss Sibby, I didn’t run away and leave you,
ma’am,” pleaded the young fellow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And plenty of room in the carryall, too, as might
have incommodated me very well. The old saying sez
as ‘Where there is a will there is a way,’ and I sez, correspondimentally,
sez I, ‘where there is a way, sez I,
there out to be a will,’ sez I. Yes! I’m talking to you,
Sam Grandiere. You had the way to take me, but you
hadn’t got the will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed, Miss Sibby, I didn’t know you wanted to
come. I should have been glad enough to take you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why didn’t you ask me, then? You might a knowed,
soon as the news reached our neighborhood as all the
folks had come back from furrin parts, and Gideon
Grandiere among ’em, as I would want to come up and
hear news of my lad. But you run away and left me
behind. And when I found it out I just said to myself,
sez I, I’ll just harness up my old mule, sez I, and I won’t
be long behind ’em, sez I. And so here I am.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you find us out?” inquired Capt. Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the funniest way as ever you see. As I was
a-driving slowly up the Pennsylwany Avenue who
should I see but that dog, Joshua, a-walking as majestical
down the street as if the whole city belonged to him.
I knowed him at once, and naterally looked to see who
was along of him. And then who should I see but that
nigger a-walking down the street behind the dog as if
the whole country belonged to him, if you please. So I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>stopped the mule and hollered to him. And the wust
of hollering after anybody on Pennsylwany Avenue is
that everybody in hearing thinks as you’re hollering
after them. So everybody had to turn and look at me
and my mule. And the nigger stood and stared. And
I had to holler after him again to ax him where his
master was a-putting up. And he come to the side of
the cart and told me, and axed me to let him get in and
drive me to the hotel, ’cause, he said, every one was
a-staring at me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so Dickson drove you here, did he, ma’am?”
inquired the old skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He did. But as for the people staring at me, sez I
to that nigger, if I am a show, I’m a free show, sez I,
and it will cost ’em nothing, sez I, and it ain’t often as
the poor white trash in the city gets a good chance to
stare at the descendant of the great duke, sez I, and you
may lay your life on that, sez I. So that nigger got in
and drove the mule, and Joshua marched behind as
solemn as a funeral procession. And so we got here.
And now how is my boy? My adopted neffy? And
where is he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Roland is in good health. He is at present—ahem!—living
on Capitol Hill,” answered the old salt, who
was unwilling at this juncture to enter into explanations
with Miss Sibby as to Roland’s real state.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And why isn’t the boy staying here with you all?”
inquired the old lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he—there is no room here. We are fearfully
crowded. The four young ladies have to sleep two in
a bed, in a double-bedded room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s ruinous to health. Why don’t you all go to
some other hotel?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because they are all more crowded than this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then what am I to do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Sam and I are going out to hunt for lodgings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>now. We have to find lodgings for my two nieces and
nephew. We will hunt up a place for you also. Of
course, you will stay here to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is perfectly dreadful! If I had a knowed all this
I’d a-never have left home. I had room enough to turn
round in there, anyways. When people’s well off, sez
I, they ought to be content, sez I. But how is Abel
Force and his wife and Odalite? I don’t see any of ’em
round.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mrs. Force is not well, and Mr. Force is with her,
I believe. Odalite went to show my two nieces to a room
to take off their things,” discreetly answered the old
sailor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter along of Elfrida Force?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well—she——I really don’t know. Not much, I
hope.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know. It’s trotting around so much. There’s
where it is. When people gets to be past their prime,
sez I, they ought to take care of what’s left of them, sez
I. ‘Dancing bears,’ sez I, ‘must pay for their airs,’
sez I.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What sort of a time have you had since the war
began, Miss Sibby?” inquired the old salt, with a view
to take the visitor off dangerous ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he “fell from the frying pan into the fire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old lady’s face flushed, and her eyes snapped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t ask me what sort of a time I’ve had! Old
Scratch’s own time! What with being raided by first
one party and then another, I have hardly a sheep or a
pig or a duck or a hen left on the place. And what with
being called a rebel by the Unioners and a traitor by the
Confederers, I have hardly a morsel of self-respect or
Christian charity left in my heart. And I haven’t a
bit of respect for either party—not I! Clapper-clawing
each other like a pack o’ wild cats for nothing in this
world, as I can see, ’less it is because they haven’t got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>no furriners to clapper-claw. If free people can’t live
peaceable in a free, healthy, plentiful country, sez I,
the sooner they get the Turkey of Constantinople to rule
over them the better, sez I.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You seem to be excited, Miss Sibby.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So would you be excited if you had suffered all that
I have. First comes the Unioners and carries off all my
pigs, and calls me a rebel because I object. And then
comes the Confederers and carries off all my fowls, and
calls me a traitor because I don’t see the right of it.
Unioners and Confederers! I calls ’em Blue Bottle
Flies and Gray Back Bugs, I do!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Miss Sibby!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, then, I do! I hain’t no patience with neither
party! A cutting and a slashing at each other like
Injuns! Only last week a lot of Blue Bottles come riding
up and searched the house after a spy—as if I would
harbor a spy!—and after eating up and drinking up
everything in the house, and putting me in fear of my
life, they mounted and rode away, telling me ‘to take
care of myself’! ‘Take care of myself,’ indeed; after
scaring me almost to death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Miss Sibby! I am afraid you are no——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever he was going to say was cut short by the
sudden opening of the door, and the reëntrance of Odalite
Force, escorting Mrs. Hedge and Miss Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You here, Miss Sibby?” exclaimed the three ladies,
in a breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What the Blue Bottles and the Gray Backs has left
of me is here, as you see,” replied Miss Bayard, rising
to receive the welcome of the new arrivals.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now, Sam, my boy, we will go out hunting
lodgings; and if we can’t find them in the city we will
even go a little way into the country,” said the old skipper,
as he arose and bowed himself out of the room, followed
by his nephew.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>When they had gone, Lord Enderby, who had been
left out of the talk, now fancied himself out of place.
So he likewise arose and bowed himself out.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the half dozen women were left in the parlor,
they drew their chairs together and fell into a confidential
talk.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Sibby inquired more particularly into the nature
of Mrs. Force’s illness; and Wynnette, with her brusque
frankness, told the truth—that the shock of hearing of
Roland Bayard’s arrest and imprisonment, under the
charge of piracy, had made the lady ill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Sibby just stared with incredulous amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Roland Bayard! My Roland—charged with piracy?
Why, it is all a funny mistake, you know, that must
soon be set right! And that old gay deceiver, Gideon
Grandiere, to go and tell me that he was boarding on
Capitol Hill, when he was in prison there! What did
he do it for? Was he afeared of scaring me about my
own Roland? Why, Lor’, sez I, when I know my boy is
innocent, sez I, I know his innocence is gwine to shine
forth like the sun at midday, sez I, and make his accusers
ashamed, sez I.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here it was felt to be right Miss Sibby should be told
of the real state of the case. And so she had to hear all
about the taking of the <em>Kitty</em> by the <em>Argente</em>; when the
skipper and his mate were made prisoners by the pirate,
who set the former at liberty on the coast of Cornwall,
and kept the latter a captive on board the <em>Argente</em>; and
then of the capture of the <em>Argente</em> by the <em>Eagle</em>, and the
bringing of the prize into port with the pirate captain
and his first officer on board; and, finally, the identification
of the two prisoners as Angus Anglesea, alias Capt.
Silver, and Roland Bayard, alias Craven Cloud; and
the alleged paternal claim of the former upon the latter,
which now closed the lips of the claimed son from saving
himself by testifying against the self-styled father.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Miss Sibby’s eyes opened, her brows raised, and her
chin dropped in sheer horrified amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, them’s all lies!” she indignantly exclaimed.
“Abel Force knows they’re lies! Why don’t he go and
tell the boy better? As to that Anglesea a-turning out
to be no Anglesea at all, no English gentleman at all,
and no military officer at all, but just a pirate, after
being a thief and a forger, I’m not a bit surprised at
that. No more would I be surprised if he was found out
to be Old Scratch himself, allowed to come on earth in
the human form in these very bad times. But as for
anything going amiss with my boy on account of his
being stuffed with lies about that pirate being of his own
father, it shan’t be done! Me and Abel Force will put a
stop to that! Abel Force knows who that boy’s father
is; and I have my suspicions. There shan’t be a hair
of his head hurt! Mind that!” said the old lady, shaking
her head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Miss Sibby!” pleaded little Rosemary, clasping
her hands prayerfully, and raising her large blue eyes
to the speaker’s face. “Can you—will you—save Roland?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Abel Force can, and he will, or I’ll know the reason
why!” replied Miss Bayard.</p>

<p class='c007'>For hours longer the conversation ran on Roland Bayard
and the net of circumstances that had caught him in
this perilous false position.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were still talking when the two gentlemen returned,
and reported that they had found comfortable
lodgings for the travelers, who might take possession of
their new quarters that evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is Abel Force?” inquired the captain, as they
all went down to luncheon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa sent word down that he did not need luncheon,
but would join us at dinner in the evening,” replied
Odalite.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>And they began the meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>And meanwhile where was Abel Force?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIII<br> <span class='c005'>TOO GREAT A BURDEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Abel Force went into the little room he had engaged,
adjoining the sick chamber of his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was no more than a closet, and had evidently been
used as a dressing room attached to the large chamber
before the exigencies of war had rendered space in the
house too valuable for the little place to be used for any
purpose but a bedroom.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was furnished very simply, with an iron bedstead,
a washstand with a glass above it, a single chair, and
half a dozen wooden pegs on the door to hang clothes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force turned the back of the only chair to the
window that was opposite the door and overlooked the
yard; and he sat down and drew the packet he had
taken from his wife’s room, and again looked at the
superscription.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, it was directed in a firm hand to:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Abel Force, Esq.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was tied up with cord and sealed with wax.</p>

<p class='c007'>But under the cord a little note had been slipped, and
this also was addressed—but in a weak and tremulous
hand—to:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Abel Force, Esq.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He opened the note to read it. It was without date;
yet he felt sure that it must have been written on that
very morning before the sudden fall of the woman had
prevented her flight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The note ran as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“The hour has come when I must drop the mask of
deceit and show myself in my true colors—a living lie,
a hypocrite, though never, never happy in falsehood and
hypocrisy. Your love and trust have wounded and tortured
me; the reverence of children has humiliated me.
No, never for a moment happy or at ease in my disguise.
It is almost a relief now to throw it off and reveal myself
as I am, even though the revelation must banish me
from your presence and my children’s forever in this
world, and perhaps in the next. Yet, I repeat, it is a
relief to throw off the disguise which has suffocated me
like a heavy cloak these many years; and has been more
than that—has been like Medea’s robe of fire for the
last few years since Anglesea’s first visit to us.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The inclosed packet contains a manuscript that was
written at intervals during this time, and with a view
to the chance of just such a crisis as has now come. I
leave it for you to read. I do not ask you to pardon me,
for I know there is no such thing as pardon for me in
this world. I do not even ask you to judge charitably
of me—charity is for the sinner, not for the hypocrite.
I only ask you to read the story that you may understand
the fiendish hold one human being had upon my
body, soul and spirit—my very life here and hereafter;
and, after having read it, I, who have no right to ask
you anything, dare still to ask you this—to ask, to plead,
to pray that you will be kind to one who is the guiltless
victim of others’ guilt, and to save him, if you can. And
now, farewell! And oh! my whole heart goes out in
this cry. Oh, God! Oh, God! though I cannot be pardoned—yet,
oh! hear my prayer, and save and bless my
husband and my children!”</p>

<p class='c006'>That was all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abel Force dropped his head upon his breast, and remained
in deep thought for a few moments. Then, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>a heavy sigh, he aroused himself, drew a match case from
his pocket, lighted a match, set fire to the little note and
held it down upon the stone window sill, with the point
of his penknife, until it was consumed to ashes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he went to lock his door, to prevent intrusion;
but he found that he had already taken that precaution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, he returned to his chair, cut the cords of the
packet, broke the seal, and read as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“THE STORY OF A WITHERED HEART</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have often heard how lonely, loveless and neglected
was my childhood and youth. You are reminded
of these facts now, not in excuse of what followed, but
as the causes of the effects that destroyed my life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know that I was born at Enderby Castle, where
the first years of my infancy passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I was scarcely four years of age I lost my
mother—too young to understand or to lament my loss.
The pageantry of her funeral is one of the strongest impressions
among the brain pictures of that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A few days after that event my father left Enderby,
taking me with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We went to Weirdwaste, an estate he had acquired
through his marriage with my mother, situated on the
west coast of Ireland. It was, if possible, even more
drear, lonely and desolate than Enderby Cliff itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This place, in which I was destined to pass my childhood,
was built of gray stone, two stories high, around
the four sides of a hollow quadrangle, at the inland end
of a long, flat point of land stretching far out into the
Atlantic Ocean, which at high tide swept over it, covering
more than two-thirds of the ground; and the moan
of the sea never ceased from the sorrowful shore.
North, west and south around the point of land nothing
but sky and water was to be seen. East—inland—was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>wild waste, dotted here and there by the huts of the
poorest peasantry on the island, and that means, also,
the poorest people on the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The old manor house was shockingly out of repair,
but because it was the best building on the estate it was
occupied by my father’s land steward, O’Nally, and
his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These two had been old servants of my mother’s
family, and had been very much devoted to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After my father’s arrival with me at the house they
also acted in the capacity of butler and housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father had brought with him a valet and a
groom, and for me a nurse and a governess.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was very warmly welcomed and fondly caressed
by my mother’s old servants, and so for the first few
days I was very happy at Weirdwaste.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We had no neighbors but the poor tenantry in the
huts, on the waste behind the manor house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And we saw no company but the vicar of the little
Protestant parish, in the village of Bantrim, ten miles
inland, and the county practitioner from the same place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These two old men remain strong, clear portraits in
the gallery of my memory.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The vicar, Mr. Clement, was a large, fair, clean-shaved,
bald-headed old gentleman, with blue eyes and
a beaming smile. He was very, very good to me, and
I soon learned to love him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The medical practitioner, Dr. Alexander, was a tall,
gaunt, high-nosed, red-faced man, with a shock of iron-gray
hair and whiskers; a formidable frown and a
brusque manner. He also was very, very kind to me,
but I never got over my fear of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father did not intend to remain at Weirdwaste,
as I soon found out. He had the vicar and doctor come
and spend the day and dine at the house, so that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>might see the child who was to be left at Weirdwaste
under their joint care.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The doctor pronounced me a wonderfully sound and
healthy child, who would grow finely in the pure, invigorating
air of the seaside. The doctor promised to look
after my health, and the vicar to superintend my education.
And both engaged to write frequently and keep
my father advised as to my welfare.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, having taken every precaution he thought necessary
to my well-being, and having settled the urgent
business that brought him to Ireland, my father bade
me good-by, and left Weirdwaste to travel on the Continent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then began the loneliest life ever led by motherless
child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O’Nally and his wife were an old couple. They
kept two old servants—a woman, who did the housework;
and a man, who did the outdoor work. And they
kept an old horse and an old jaunting car.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My nurse was a respectable, elderly matron; my
governess, a discreet, middle-aged maiden, selected by
my father especially for good qualities. Surely I had
all the care and protection that was needed. But I had
no love, no play, no amusement, no companions. Even
the warm-hearted peasant women, who had come down
from their huts on the waste to welcome their little lady
of the manor, came no more after that first day—not
that they had ceased to care for me, but because the
occasion of their coming had passed, and their hard
work kept them all at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On fine Sundays O’Nally took me in the jaunting
car, with himself and his wife, to church, and we heard
Mr. Clement preach, and after the service I sometimes
got a pat on the head, and a smile and kind word from
the vicar. He was a widower without children, so I
never was asked to his house.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“Once a week the county practitioner rode out to the
manor house to see after my health, that he might report
to my father. Also, if no one from Weirdwaste happened
to go to church on a Sunday, the vicar would ride
out to the manor in the course of the week to inquire
the cause of absence, and report to my father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These occasional drives to church on Sundays, and
semi-occasional visits from the vicar and the doctor,
were the only variations in the monotony of my days,
which were ordinarily passed in this way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At seven o’clock in the morning, Nurse Burns would
wake me up, give me a bath, and dress me in such a
plain black frock! I had not even the pleasure of pretty
clothes! And then she would give me my breakfast—such
a plain breakfast of oatmeal and milk! I had
never the indulgence of cakes or sugar plums, which
was all very well for me, no doubt, but which was also
very dull. Then came Miss Murray with the school
books, and I would sit alone with her in the schoolroom,
trying to study my first reader, while she sat reading or
sewing, but scarcely ever speaking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then came the noon dinner of boiled mutton and
potatoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And after that more school for an hour or two.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then a walk on the sands, all around the point, if
the tide was low; or, if the tide were high and the cape
covered with water, we took a walk on the waste behind
the manor house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sometimes I got a letter from my father, inclosed
in one to the steward or to my governess.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIV<br> <span class='c005'>A NEW MOTHER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“One day I received a terrible shock. Child as I
was, I felt it severely. It came so suddenly, so unexpectedly,
that it fell like a thunderbolt upon me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a morning in November when the carrier’s
cart stopped at the manor house, and left a box directed
to me, in the care of the steward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When it was opened, it revealed a beautiful cake
wrapped in many folds of silver paper. I was delighted,
for I had not tasted cake for months.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, oh! I did not taste it even then! The letter
that lay on the top of the cake poisoned it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That letter told me that my father had married and
was spending his honeymoon in Paris. I had a stepmother!
A being whom, I knew not how, or why, unless
perhaps from the idle talk of servants, I had learned
to hate as an evil and to dread as an enemy—though it
never occurred to me that my father would give me one.
And yet he had married within five months after my
mother’s death.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could not touch the poisoned cake! I know not
what became of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cried all that day and many days after. The
steward and his wife and the two old servants who had
known and loved and served my mother, encouraged me
with their sympathy and lamentations to yield to my
grief and despair; but the governess frowned upon me
and lectured me upon my duty to my parents, as it was
her business to do—only it seemed to me cruel in her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As days passed my passionate grief subsided.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father did not bring his bride to Weirdwaste,
which was, indeed, no fit place to bring a fine lady.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Nor did he send for me to join them wherever they
might be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He heard regularly from me through the doctor, the
vicar, the steward, or my governess. And he seemed to
be content with my condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So the year passed away. I was thankful to my
father for one thing—that he did not bring my stepmother
and myself together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This was all wrong, but I did not know it then. I
was unconsciously influenced by the sentiments of my
own mother’s own old servants who were about me, and
who, whenever Miss Murray was out of sight, would
commiserate with me on the subject of my stepmother,
and then rejoice with me on the fact that no future heir
to Enderby that might be born of the second marriage,
could deprive me of my inheritance of Weirdwaste,
which was mine in right of my own mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah me! Enderby Castle and Weirdwaste sounded
well enough in the peerage, but in point of fact the
united rent roll of both places did not reach over a thousand
pounds per annum, and my father, for his rank,
was a very poor man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I expected to see my father at Christmas. He wrote
to the steward to say that he would come and bring Lady
Enderby with him, and that the house must be made as
comfortable as possible for her reception; and that the
suit of rooms pointing south must be fitted up for her
especial use.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This letter filled my soul with dismay. I could have
looked forward with delight to the visit of my father,
had he been coming alone; but I could only dread the
meeting with my stepmother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“However, both the pleasure and the pain were saved
me, for after the servants had got the house ready for
the reception of my father and his new wife, there came
another letter saying that the delicate health of Lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Enderby obliged him to take her to Italy for the winter.
And in place of my father and stepmother’s visit, came
a box of presents.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was again divided in my feelings—sorry not to
see my father, glad not to see my stepmother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Christmas box was a large and well-filled one,
packed with flannels and blankets, and tea and sugar for
the old women in the huts on the waste, and containing
another smaller box with cakes, sweetmeats and sugar
plums for me and my small household.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I heard the steward remark to his wife that the new
countess must be well off, or the earl must have come
into money some way, for this was the very first Christmas
that he had ever sent anything to the poor on the
estate. As the guardian of his daughter, the heiress,
he forgave many of them their rent, but he never helped
them in any other way. And so at Christmas the old
people on the waste were made happy. And now let me
add here that as long as I remained at the old manor
house this Christmas dole came every year.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After this I heard less of the cruelty of my father in
afflicting me with a stepmother. I heard even less of
the wickedness of stepmothers in general and the probable
enormity of my stepmother in particular.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The old people from the waste came down in crowds
to the manor house on Christmas Day to thank me for
the dole that had been sent to them on Christmas Eve.
This was the only pleasure we had. There was no merrymaking,
and the state of the roads prevented us even
from going to church.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, the dreary winter that followed! No one came
to the house except the vicar and the doctor, who made
weekly calls to report to my father. And we went nowhere
at all. That was my first winter at Weirdwaste.
And here let me add that all succeeding winters were
like that.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“I had no companions, no amusements, no occupations
except my schoolbooks and my piano. I had not even
a pet bird, or cat, or dog.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The steward and his wife were good to me, but they
were engaged in their affairs. Miss Murray was faithful,
but when she was not hearing my lessons, or guiding
my fingers over the keys of the piano, she was busied in
reading. I never knew anybody to read so much as she
did. She had no other recreation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When the spring returned we began to take walks
on the sand again when the tide was out; and we drove
to church on Sundays when the state of the roads permitted
us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the first of August we received news from my
father. He was at Enderby Castle, to which he had
taken my stepmother for a temporary sojourn. He
wrote to the steward to tell him that an heir had been
born to Enderby; and he wrote to me to say that my
new mother had given me a dear little brother, and that
he hoped I would love them both very much.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was not quite four years old when my own dear
mother died. I was but a few weeks past five now when
I was told that I had a little brother by my father’s new
wife, and that I must love both.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could not do it. You will see what a sensitive
and badly trained child I was when I tell you that I
fell into hysterical sobs and tears, and refused to be
comforted. It seemed to me that I had quite lost my
father—that he had been taken away from me by the
new woman and the new child. I remember crying
aloud to my own mother in heaven to come and take
me away, because no one cared for me on earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Murray coaxed, lectured, remonstrated, all in
vain. I would not hear reason or receive consolation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The two O’Nallys and the two old servants sympathized
with me, and petted me, and cried over me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>They never said a word against my father or my stepmother,
personally or in my presence; but I often overheard
them saying it was ‘a burning shame to neglect a
child as I was neglected; that I ought to be with my
father and stepmother, wherever they were,’ etc., etc.
And their words deepened in me the sense of injury I
felt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And yet, in justice to my father and his wife, I must
say that no wrong was intended me. We were all the
victims of circumstances, as you will judge as I go on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was on this occasion that I wrote my first letter
to my father, with much help from my governess.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As soon as I had got over my paroxysms of grief,
which did not happen for days, Miss Murray insisted
that I should answer my father’s letter and wish him
joy of his heir, and send my love to my new mother and
little brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This I most positively refused to do, declaring, with
a new burst of tears, that I did not wish him any joy in
his son; that I did not love my new brother, and that I
had no new mother. I had but one mother, who was in
heaven, and I should never have another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My governess insisted, and tried to intimidate me
into compliance. Whereupon I told her that she should
not wish to make me write falsehoods, and that for my
part I was quite ready to be burned at the stake, like
Bishop Bonner, for the truth’s sake, rather than write
what I did not feel and what was not true.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see from this what a morbid, sensitive, extravagant
little soul I was even at that tender age, and what
exaggerated views I took of every trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My governess had to yield the point. How could
she even wish her pupil to write falsely? We compromised
the matter by my consenting to write a short
note to my father, telling him that I was glad to hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>that he was well, and asking him when he would come
to see me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A week later I got a most affectionate letter from my
father, saying that he would visit his ‘dear little daughter’
as soon as he thought it would be safe to leave his
wife, who had lain in a low condition ever since the
arrival of her babe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But my father did not come.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was, in fact, October before the countess was able
to leave her room. Then her physicians ordered her to
the south of France, whither my father soon took her,
with her infant son.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Another dreary winter followed me at Weirdwaste.
The same confinement to the house, without companions,
or amusements, or occupations—except my elderly attendants
and my schoolbooks and music. No visitors
except the vicar and the doctor. No visits except to
church on exceptional Sundays when the roads were
passable. I grew into a very strange child, precocious
in a certain sort of intelligence gained from books, but
backward in all knowledge of child life and depressed in
spirits.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I received occasional letters from my father, and
wrote others, touched up by my governess.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXV<br> <span class='c005'>FATHER AND DAUGHTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“It was not until the next June, when we had been
parted nearly two years, that I saw my father again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He came over suddenly and dropped down on us, so
to speak, on the morning of the fifth of that month.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Steward and housekeeper were both ‘taken aback’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>and ‘flustered,’ as they described themselves; yet they
were not unprepared. The house was always as well
kept as the circumstances would permit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor was Miss Murray. She also had done her duty
and could present her pupil without fear of criticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We were both in the schoolroom, my governess and
I, when the door opened and some one entered unannounced.
I looked up from my slate, to see a tall,
stately man, with a pale face framed in black hair and
black whiskers, standing in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I recognized my father and flew to his embrace, before
Miss Murray could rise to receive him with deliberate
decorum.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father kissed me with much love and received
Miss Murray’s greetings with stately politeness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Later on, when I had recovered from my surprise
and excitement at his sudden appearance, he explained
that he had but lately returned to England and had
taken his delicate wife and child to London, which was
then, in the fine June days, at the height of the fashionable
season, and had left them on a visit to his mother-in-law,
the Dowager Lady Burnshot, who had a fine
house near Hyde Park; and that he had seized this first
opportunity to run to Ireland to see his dear little
daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He further explained that he could not bring the
countess and the little viscount because she could not
bear the sea air yet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He brought me a doll and a doll’s set of furniture,
all of which delighted me almost as much as his visit,
for—will it be believed?—I had not possessed a doll
since the death of my own mother, and I was only six
years old.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father remained only a few days at Weirdwaste,
during which he invited the vicar and the doctor to dine
and talk with him over the affairs of the estate, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>condition of my health, to thank them for their past
kindness, and to ask their continued supervision of his
daughter’s welfare.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I cannot take her with me to London at present,’
he said, ‘for we are visiting at the house of Lady Burnshot,
the mother of my wife. Besides, I think, for her
own sake, little Elfrida is much better here for a few
years longer.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The doctor and the vicar agreed with my father, that
I was much better off at Weirdwaste than I could be
in London. And so there was no more to be said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father took a very loving leave of me at the end
of the week.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After he was gone I grieved myself sick! I loved
him so dearly! I longed to go with him so ardently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it was not to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do I linger over these details? Is it because
we all grow garrulous when talking or writing of our
childhood? Or is it because I dread to approach the
period of my life’s tragedy? Or do both these causes
combine to influence me? I know not; but I know that
I must hurry toward that from which I shrink.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A few weeks after this, being in the heat of summer,
my father came again to see me, bringing my stepmother
and my little baby brother with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He had written to apprise us of the visit, so we
were all ready for him. All the animosity I had ever
felt against my stepmother vanished when I saw her
pale, patient face. My child heart pitied her, and from
pity I loved her; and did everything in my small power
to please her; except this—I would not call her mother.
I said it would not be right toward my own dear mother,
who was in heaven. And she kissed me, and said she
only was sorry she had not been able to do a mother’s
part by her motherless child, for that she, too, would
soon be in heaven, where she would meet my own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>mother, when she could only tell her that she loved, but
had not been able to serve, her daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As for my infant brother, now a year old, I idolized
him. His mother delighted in my affection for her
child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I have not been able to be good to you, my poor
little girl; but you will be good to him when I am gone,
will you not?’ she inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Indeed, indeed, I will. I will love him better than
myself. I will die for him,’ I said, taking the extravagant
view and using the exaggerated language that was
usual with me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The chills of autumn come very early at Weirdwaste,
and so about the middle of September, when the evenings
began to be cold, my father took my stepmother
and my baby brother back and settled them for a few
weeks at Torquay, then believed to be the best winter
resort in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I grieved after them for a week or more. And, oh!
how I wondered why they could not take me with them!</p>

<p class='c007'>“The reason was this, as I afterward learned: that
the state of Lady Enderby’s health made it impossible
for me to be with them, especially in a lodging house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father did not visit Weirdwaste again for a long
time. He spent the winter with his wife and infant son
at Torquay, and in the early summer took them to
Switzerland, and in autumn to the Grecian Archipelago.
In fact, two more years passed before I saw my father
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then it was June and the height of the London season,
and he had brought his wife to London and left
her on a visit to her mother, the Baroness Burnshot.
But on this occasion he brought my little brother over to
Ireland and down to Weirdwaste.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The child was now called Viscount Glennon, and
was a beautiful boy nearly three years old.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“I was at that time a little old woman of eight. All
the years that I have lived and all the sorrows that I
have suffered have never made me as old as I was at
eight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But again my heart leaped to meet father and
brother, and I loved and adored them. I asked why my
stepmother had not come with them. My father told
me that she was much too frail to bear the sea air even
in summer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was satisfied with my health, and with my progress
in learning, and so he left us, taking the boy with
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had now been more than four years at dreary
Weirdwaste, and had not known any home but the old
manor house, or any society than its inmates. As these
first four years passed so passed the next seven.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father came about once a year to see me, bringing
my brother with him. He always spent a week at
Weirdwaste, and then returned to England, taking my
brother with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His time was entirely devoted to his invalid wife,
whose life seemed only to be prolonged by his incessant
care.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They were always moving from place to place, as
the seasons changed—in Switzerland, or in Norway, or
Sweden in the summer; in the south of France, in Italy,
or among the isles of the Grecian Archipelago in winter.
Sometimes in the finest weather of the early summer
they came to London, during which time the countess
would visit her mother, and then my father would
take my little brother and come on a flying visit to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So the years went on until I reached my fifteenth
year, when the days of my dark destiny drew near.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You may never have occasion to read these lines,
yet I come to my task from time to time to prepare
them for you.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me resume:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never was reconciled to my lonely life at Weirdwaste,
but as the years passed on, and I grew toward
womanhood the solitude and monotony of my surroundings
pressed more and more heavily upon my health
and spirits.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father in these years seemed almost to have forgotten
me. He was with my mother on one of the
islands of the Grecian Archipelago—for her health.
My little brother—now a well-grown schoolboy—was at
Rugby. You see, our family of four was scattered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“About this time my health and spirits became so
seriously affected that Dr. Alexander thought it necessary
to call my father’s attention to the fact. He wrote
to him, and in due time received an answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was something to this effect:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘As you recommend the south coast, you will please
take the girl to Brighton, and take suitable lodgings for
herself and her attendants. As she is no longer a child
she must have more advanced teachers. Miss Murray
may be retained as her companion or chaperon, but a
French governess must be engaged for her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I leave all this to you. Our good vicar will be able
to assist you.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘My son will join his sister at the seaside for the
midsummer holidays. Draw on me for the necessary
funds.’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“The prospect of any change filled my soul with delightful
anticipations.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was now the middle of June. By the first of July
I was established in delightful lodgings on the King’s
Road, facing the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We had the whole of the first floor, consisting of a
suit of eight rooms—drawing room, dining room, schoolroom,
bathroom and four bedrooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was delighted with the gay vision of life and
motion all around me; there seemed to be a perpetual
gala.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The splendor of the view from my front windows
was not all the splendor of sea and sky; it was fleets of
gayly decked craft, of all sizes and shapes, from the
queenly yacht to the pretty little rowboats; and the pier,
with its bazaars of toys, trinkets and jewelry; the bathing
houses, the frolicsome children in the surf or on the
sands, the brilliant crowds on the esplanade, the bands
of music, the magnificent shops, with displays of sumptuous
fabrics and splendid jewels, not to be surpassed in
those of Paris or Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In fact, to me, who had never been in a town before—to
me, coming from lonely and dreary Weirdwaste—Brighton
was a dazzling, bewildering scene of light, life,
gayety, splendor and magnificence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if it was all this viewed only from the front
windows of my lodgings, what was it, let me ask you,
afterward, when my schoolboy brother and his friends
came, full of high spirits, to make the most of our opportunities?</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the second day after our installment at our lodgings
we were joined by the French governess who had
been engaged for me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She was a small, dark, middle-aged woman, with
black hair, and sharp, black eyes. Her name was De
la Champe—Madame de la Champe. Her last place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>had been in the service of a duchess, whose last daughter
having just been married, madame found herself
under the necessity of seeking a new engagement, and
had found one through the vicar’s answer to her advertisement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not like her, though she came so highly recommended.
But my prejudice against the Frenchwoman
was not the slightest drawback to my intense enjoyment
of my new and delightful surroundings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the fourth day after our arrival we were joined
by my brother and his friend. My brother was then a
bright lad of twelve, looking older than his years, because
he was really a very precocious boy. He greeted
me with the warmest affection, and promised me a
‘jolly old time.’ His friend was Angus Anglesea, a
young man eight years his senior, who, however, had
formed a strong attachment for the bright lad, and taken
him under his protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Angus Anglesea was at this time about twenty years
of age; with a form of medium height, slender and fair,
with light hair and mustache, and blue eyes. His appearance
and manners were pleasing and attractive.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could not have believed any evil of him then.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the day after the arrival of my brother and his
friend, the good doctor, who had accompanied us to
Brighton, took his leave, after having warned my teachers
that their office was, for the present, a sinecure, and
that there were really to be no lessons for the next three
months, or until my health should be fully reëstablished.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After the doctor left our days were given up to enjoyment—walks
on the esplanade, sails on the sea, bathing
in the surf, drives along the coast, rides over the
downs, saunters on the pier—a perpetual recurrence of
delightful recreations, each one enhancing the pleasures
of all the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It seemed paradise to me. My brother lived with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>us, of course. Angus Anglesea had lodgings near us,
and came every day to join in our amusements.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Eleventh Hussars were stationed at Brighton
Barracks then, and the officers were often on parade.
Anglesea was not at that time in the army. He received
his commission afterward; but he knew a number
of the officers, and introduced some of them to me. My
French governess or my English teacher was always at
my side on these occasions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So three enchanting months passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My brother’s holidays were over, and he was now to
go to Eton. My father’s London solicitor was charged
with the duty of making all the arrangements for his
entrance into college.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the fifteenth of September he left me, with the
promise to return and spend the Christmas holidays
with me, for I was to winter at Brighton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Angus Anglesea remained at Brighton. Friends and
neighbors of his father’s, in Lancashire—the Earl and
Countess of Middlemoor, with their only daughter—had
arrived at their seaside home on Brunswick Terrace,
and Anglesea had remained to see them. Even
then he was reported to be engaged to the Lady Mary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Soon I heard that young Anglesea had left his lodgings
and accepted the invitation of the earl and countess
to make their house his home during his sojourn at the
seaside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After this we did not see so much of young Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He came but seldom to our lodgings, and never
joined us in our walks on the seaside. Whenever we
chanced to meet him, he was in the company of the
Middlemoors, either driving or walking with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Brighton had seemed to me the paradise of life
and light, splendor and gayety, in the summer months,
when the season was at its lowest ebb, what was it, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>you please, in the early autumn, when the tide of wealth
and fashion set in?</p>

<p class='c007'>“No words of mine can describe my impression of it,
my delight in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The bijou of a theater and the elegant assembly
rooms were opened for the season. The ‘paradise’ was
one panorama of brilliant crowds. It was like nothing
real to my simplicity.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVII<br> <span class='c005'>LUIGI SAVIOLA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I come now to the most fateful day of my unhappy
life. The day on which Luigi Saviola was presented
to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was in November; but it was bright and sunny
on the seashore.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My companion and chaperon—once my English
teacher—Miss Murray, was confined to the house by a
slight attack of bronchitis, which she was carefully nursing
lest it should become serious.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was walking on the esplanade, attended by my
French governess.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At that early hour, ten in the morning, there were
but few people out besides nursemaids and children.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We were sauntering along slowly, when we saw coming
toward us Anglesea and another young gentleman,
walking arm in arm, apparently on the most friendly
and even affectionate terms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a few minutes we met face to face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anglesea bowed, and then presented his companion:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Prince Luigi Saviola.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madame de la Champe received the stranger’s low
bow with all the courtesy of her nation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“I do not know how I received him, I wore a little
round turban hat, with a little thin, gray gauze mask
veil over my face, which completely shaded my features,
while it enabled me to look at the stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know not if there be any such thing as love at first
sight; for the only real, lasting love of my life was of
slow growth, as you know, Abel. Oh, Abel! you do
know that I love you!</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! I do not believe there is such a thing as real
love at first sight; but I do know that there is a madness
that apes it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some fascination made me look at this Italian from
behind the shield of my gray veil, while he talked with
my vivacious French governess, who quickly engaged
him in conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was young—quite youthful, indeed; and—it is
a very effeminate term to apply to a man—but he was
beautiful—not handsome, but beautiful. He was of
medium height and slender proportions; but he was
perfectly elegant in form and perfectly graceful in gesture.
His profile was purely, finely Grecian. His complexion
pale and clear, his hair, eyebrows and mustache
of darkest brown; his eyes of darkest violet blue. Yet
all this description gives but the outline of the youth’s
form and face—it cannot give the subtle and exquisite
charm of expression which was the chief beauty of his
aspect, nor can it give the lingering music of the most
melodious voice that ever spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you displeased with me, that I describe this
stranger so minutely?</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do it in cold blood, Abel, and only that you may
understand and perhaps pardon the fascination he possessed
over a sensitive, imaginative young recluse, such
as I had been. And some instinct told me even then
that this attraction was mutual, though we did not exchange
a word, and he could clearly see my face.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“After a few moments of courteous conversation, the
two young gentlemen bowed and walked on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I went home in a dream—the face and voice of the
young stranger haunting my spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Frenchwoman made some few favorable remarks
on the manner and appearance of the young
Italian; but I did not reply—I could not.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I passed the day in a vision. I was like one possessed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two days later young Anglesea made us the first call
of many days.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madame de la Champe immediately beset him with
questions about the young Italian.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I said nothing, but listened with the deepest interest
for his replies.</p>

<p class='c007'>(“This is a confession, you know, Abel. And I mean
that it shall be a full one.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“I listened with the most eager curiosity to hear all
that could be told of one who had taken complete possession
of my fancy and imagination, if not of my heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what Anglesea told us of Luigi Saviola did but
deepen the profound interest I already took in the young
stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He told us that Saviola was of royal race, yet of advanced
republican ideas. That for the expression of his
principles he was a political exile. He was wealthy,
and his wealth had been confiscated. He was now living
in Brighton on the wreck of his fortune; but was brave,
cheerful and heroic, as we had seen him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All this, as I say, deepened my interest in Saviola,
and heightened my admiration for him. He was no
longer a most charming person, but he was a hero and
a martyr, a patriot and a humanitarian. And already
I loved, adored, worshiped him, or believed that I did.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see, Abel, what a very ‘foolish virgin’ I was.
But then, I was a motherless child.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“Anglesea was devoted to Saviola, and expressed the
most profound esteem and admiration for him. He
asked permission to bring the young Italian to call on
us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was an indiscreet request to make; but Anglesea
was young and impulsive.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was an improper favor to grant, but my governess
was vain and faithless, and had herself taken a fancy
to the young Italian, so she consented that he should
come.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The intervening time between this day and the day
of the visit was passed by me in a state of feverish anticipation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The next evening Anglesea brought Saviola. He
was much more attractive than ever. He talked mostly
with Madame de la Champe, but I felt that he looked
mostly at me—at me, who scarcely ever uttered a word.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This was the first of many calls—for some time made
only in the company of his friend, and received by me
only in the company of one or both of my governesses.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can I tell you the progress of that infatuation,
hallucination—call it what you please—that kindled at
the first meeting, and increased with every after interview?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Saviola never sat by my side in those early days;
never took my hand, except at meeting and parting,
when, with the reverential tenderness of his race, he
would raise it to his lips, bowing over it. He scarcely
ever addressed me with words, but with glances—how
eloquently! All the wooing was done through the passionate
eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At first I could not look at him at all; then only
very shyly; and then at length my eyes seemed irresistibly
attracted to meet his—even to seek to meet his eys.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Abel, I am telling you everything! I am unveiling
my heart to you! How will you receive my confession?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Will you believe that there was no conscious
sense of wrongdoing at the time? But, indeed, there
was none. Will you believe the stranger truth that this
was not love which I gave to Luigi? I did not know
what love meant until I met the one love of my life—years
after this lunacy. Oh, Abel, believe that this
delirium was not love, though even I, knowing no better,
mistook it for love at the time. It was madness; it was
hero-worship, enthusiasm. But not love. This young
Italian exile, beautiful as Adonis in his person, was
idealized and glorified in my vision by his history.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Remember how young I was—scarcely past childhood;
and remember how I had lived isolated from all
society of my own rank and age, secluded in a desolate
old manor house on the Irish, coast, whose very name—Weirdwaste—could
not tell its dreariness; spending my
solitary life in wandering by the seashore during the
days, reading the old romances and poems left on the
bookshelves of the old manor house, and dreaming
dreams and seeing visions that seemed to have come to
be realized in my present surroundings and crystallized
in the person of Saviola.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Abel! Oh, Abel! Pity and pardon me if you
can, for now I come to the part of my life which I
shrink from approaching as a child would shrink from
a fierce fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Luigi came every day now, whether Anglesea accompanied
him or not. I had learned a little Italian
from Miss Murray, at Weirdwaste, and now Madame
de la Champe was continuing my studies in that language.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Luigi found it out, and begged her permission to
bring me some standard Italian works and to assist me
in the translation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madame, who looked upon me only as a child, and
thought the attention of the young Italian so many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>tributes to her own charms, very affably consented, and
so the exile became my unpaid master in Italian.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The ‘standard’ works he brought were all poetry—Petrarch’s,
Tasso’s and others’ impassioned songs.
These he translated for me in more ways than one—with
his pen, with his tongue, and more eloquently and
effectively still with his glorious eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As for me, I was far gone in madness before Luigi
ever had the opportunity to speak one direct word of
love to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The inevitable hour came at last. I was reading
Italian poetry with Luigi.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madame de la Champe sat near, working a screen
in Berlin wool. Suddenly she got up and left the room
to match some shade of worsted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The next instant Saviola was at my feet, and, in a
sudden tempest of impassioned words, he told me what
his eyes had told me long ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This was the first time we had been alone since we
had met on the esplanade, and he had seized the occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could not reply to him; but I did not repulse him,
and he saw that I did not wish to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Madame!’ I whispered, as I heard the Frenchwoman’s
approach, which had not attracted his attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He arose at once, and resumed his attitude of teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madame entered. She had not been gone two minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gradually, as the intimacy between madame and the
exile advanced, her strict surveillance over me was relaxed.
I was still a child in her eyes, and she was a
charming woman who had fired the young Italian with
admiration. So she did not feat to leave Luigi and
myself together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As for Miss Murray, she hated all foreigners, especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Italians, and most especially political exiles, so
she was seldom present during Saviola’s calls. We had
many a <em>tête-à-tête</em>. And for a few weeks we lived happily
in mere certainty that we could see and talk with
each other every day. But then came a change.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Luigi became restless and unhappy. He never
smiled now. He often sighed heavily. He grew paler
than his custom and very thin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madame—poor madame—thought the youth was
pining away for her love. And surely she did all she
could to encourage him to speak plainly to her; all she
could, except to tell him in so many words that she was
ready to marry him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One day she sent me out of the room, and was with
him alone for an hour. I think then she really did propose
to him, and that he saved himself without wounding
her, for when she recalled me to the room Saviola
was gone, and she was in tears, when she said to me:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Ah, the poor prince! He is so honorable, so conscientious.
He sacrifices—he immolates himself! It is
for duty—it is for patriotism! We must cure him of
all that.’”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br> <span class='c005'>A MAD ACT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“So thanks to the blind vanity of the French governess,
the young Italian and her pupil escaped her
suspicion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We were Romeo and Juliet. We were Francesca
and Paolo, Tasso and Leonora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! I have often thought since that it was well, in
the interest of poetry and romance, that the story of
these lovers never carried them into matrimony; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>such delirious passion is not the love that lasts through
a long life!</p>

<p class='c007'>“A disastrous day was fast approaching us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Luigi had been for some time suffering under the
deepest depression of spirits. Madame looked at him
and sighed as if she understood his secret sorrow and
could console him, if he were not so morbidly honorable
and conscientious, if he were not so determined to sacrifice,
to immolate himself on the altar of duty and
patriotism.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One morning she left the room on some errand that
her restlessness suggested.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In another moment Luigi was again at my feet,
pleading with me now to give myself to him, or rather
to take him for myself, for my lover, adorer and husband
at once and forever.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He explained in rapid, vehement words that he was
recalled to Italy; that he must go; that he could not and
would not leave me behind; he would rather die than
leave me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All this, and much more, he poured forth in a torrent
of words, to which I only replied by tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He went on rapidly explaining, lest we should be
interrupted before he got through. He told me that all
was arranged for our flight. That Anglesea would help
us and keep our secret.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Madame!’ I whispered, as my quick ears heard a
footstep on the hall outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Meet me on the pier—four o’clock this afternoon.
Come without fail, if you care to save me from selfdestruction!’
he hastily whispered, as he arose and resumed
his seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was not madame who entered, however; it was
Miss Murray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She bowed stiffly to the Italian, and then glanced
searchingly around the room. Seeing no one present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>but Saviola and myself—realizing that we were <em>tête-à-tête</em>—she
frowned and sharply demanded:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Where is madame?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘She has just left the room,’ I replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Very improper, very irregular, most reprehensible!
I shall write to-day,’ she said, as she sat down bolt
upright on the chair nearest us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Murray was a conscientious woman, and she
did her duty; there was no doubt of that! but her words
and her threatened action decided me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Swift as lightning through my mind sped this question:
What will be the effect of her letter to my father?
Something that will separate me at once and forever
from Saviola? I could not for a moment endure the
thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I looked at my lover, and my look said plainly as
tongue could speak:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I will meet you, and go with you to Italy.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“And his eyes responded with equal clearness:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I understand you, and I thank and bless you.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Soon after he took a formal leave of me, and raised
Miss Murray’s hand to his lips and kissed it with devotional
tenderness as he bowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘He is a very perfect gentleman, as indeed why
should he not be? A man of his rank?’ said the half-appeased
old maiden lady. ‘But all the same, my dear,
he is young and unmarried, and a foreigner! And, what
is worse still, he is a political refugee. Always suspicious
characters, my dear! Always suspicious characters!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘But Prince Saviola is well introduced, Miss Murray,
and he is staying with the Middlemoors,’ I ventured
to advance in my lover’s defense.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Very true, my dear! But that does not prevent
him from being a foreigner and a political refugee,’ persisted
Miss Murray, in her most absolute manner.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“‘I cannot deny the fact,’ I admitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then I went to my room and packed a small
handbag with the merest necessaries for my journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We still kept schoolroom hours for meals and had
our dinner at two o’clock.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madame drank claret and Miss Murray stout at
dinner; but both equally went to sleep in their easy
chairs over the drawing-room fire, while I was supposed
to be busy with my exercises until the five o’clock tea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now was my opportunity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As soon as my governesses were both asleep in their
chairs, I left the room, went up to my chamber, put on
my outdoor dress, took my traveling bag and left the
house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never was there before so perfectly easy and simple
a flight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I walked down the King’s Road until I reached the
new pier, and there at the land end I met Saviola and
Anglesea waiting for me. A close carriage stood within
call.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Saviola was very much agitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was Anglesea who spoke first.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My dear little girl,’ he said, as if he had been
speaking to his niece or younger sister, ‘I do not at all
approve of these proceedings; but as I feel perfectly certain
that you would go on without my consent and assistance,
I think it is best, in the interests of your absent
family, that I should aid and abet you in what you do—see
you safely, legally and regularly through it. Now
do not be frightened. We shall take the train for London.
Thence the night express for Scotland. And to-morrow
morning, as soon as we are over the border, you
shall be married. I shall not leave you until I witness
the ceremony and hold the certificate in my pocket. You
will write to your father and plead your cause as no one
but yourself can do so well. Perhaps he will storm, perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>he will reproach you, but he will end in forgiving
you—when he has considered all the circumstances.
Here is the carriage.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“While Anglesea had been talking, Saviola had
brought up the vehicle, and now he handed me into it
and entered himself, followed by Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We drove at once to the station and took tickets for
London Bridge. In five minutes we three were
crowded into a coupé; and in little more than an hour
we were at London Bridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anglesea, who had resumed the role of friend, guide
and protector to the two young maniacs, took us to a
quiet family hotel, where we three got supper in a private
sitting room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I assure you I do all this in the interests of my
friends, your relatives, my dear. I knew that Saviola
would, sooner or later, run off with you. So I determined
to see you safely through it all!’ he explained
again, as we sat down to supper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When the meal was over, Anglesea called a cab and
we all drove to King’s Cross Station, where we were
just in time to catch the night express on the Great
Northern Railway.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anglesea took a compartment for ourselves, and took
along also a basket of fruit, a bag of cakes, and a box
of bonbons, for he knew that I was still child enough to
love sweetmeats. He also took half a dozen of bottled
lemonade and ginger beer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We none of us slept a wink that night, but laughed
and talked all night, and ate and drank at intervals.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not at all feel the gravity of the situation. I
had not left any one behind whom I cared much about,
or to whom I thought I owed any duty. So, I had no
regrets or compunctions on that score.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As for my dear father, time, absence and negligence
had really estranged us, or seemed to have done so.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“I even thought my marriage might bring us closer
together; for Luigi had promised to take me to him as
soon as he should consent to see me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, without a regret for the past, or a misgiving of
the future, I yielded myself up to the joy of the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a very happy journey. Excitement kept us
all from feeling the least sense of fatigue.</p>

<p class='c007'>“About dawn we stopped at a wayside station.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Here we are,’ said Anglesea, as the guard called
out the name of the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We alighted, and Anglesea, keeping up his rôle, proposed
that we should go first to the hotel which stood on
the other side of the track.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘We must get washed, and combed, and fed, my
children, before we can present ourselves before the minister,’
he said, speaking to us as if we were indeed children
and he were quite a venerable party. He was, in
truth, younger by a year than Saviola.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We went to the hotel, the ‘Victoria,’ where two rooms
were engaged—one for me alone, and one for Anglesea
and Savialo jointly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I went to mine to refresh my toilet. I had never
dressed myself without the help of a maid in my life,
and hardly knew how to go about it. However, I rang
for the chambermaid, and with her assistance I took a
bath and made a change of clothes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After this I went down and joined Anglesea and
Saviola in the ladies’ parlor. They took me to breakfast
in the coffee room; and soon after that we all three
walked out in search of a minister. No marriage license
was required in Scotland.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We found a church, with a parsonage adjoining.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We all three passed through the gate leading into
the grounds before the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But only Anglesea went up to the door and rang the
bell.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“A servant maid opened to the summons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anglesea spoke to her, and both disappeared in the
house, leaving the door ajar.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After a few minutes Anglesea reappeared at the
door, and with a smile beckoned us to come in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We entered the hall, and were immediately conducted
by our ‘guide, philosopher and friend’ to the minister’s
study on the right hand of the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There stood a venerable man, with white hair, and
clothed in clerical black, to receive us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very few questions were put to us, and our answers,
mostly given through Anglesea, were satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We were then asked to come up and take our stand
before the minister. And in a very few minutes the
marriage ceremony, which I believed had made us man
and wife, was completed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then the old minister gave us a solemn lecture on
the duties we had assumed. And then he made a fervent
prayer for us, and ended by giving us his blessing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anglesea paid him a munificent fee, for which the
old man gave him thanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘And a marriage certificate, if you please, reverend
sir. I am acting on the part of this young lady’s absent
friends, and I must omit no necessary formality,’ said
Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The demand was unusual; the certificate was considered
unnecessary. The old minister told us so, and
added that he had no printed form and never had had
any.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Then we will take a written form. Just write that
on this day, in this place, you have united in marriage,
Luigi Saviola, of Naples, Italy, and Elfrida Glennon,
of Northumberland, England. Sign it yourself, as the
minister, and allow me to sign it as a witness. It would
also be better, too, if you could call in some member of
your family to sign as a second witness. I think I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>seen the young woman who let us in peeping through the
door through the whole performance. Please call her as
a second witness.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The old man sighed and sat down to the table where
his stationery lay, and wrote out the certificate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anglesea read it critically, expressed himself satisfied,
affixed his signature as witness, and then put the
pen in the hand of the maid, who had been called in for
the purpose, and who now scrawled her name under that
of Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And it was finished.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIX<br> <span class='c005'>AFTER THE MARRIAGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“We took leave of the old minister, who shook hands
warmly with us at parting, repeating his benediction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We returned to the hotel, where Anglesea paid the
bill and reclaimed our bags.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then we went to the station, where we had to wait
some little time for the London train.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It came up about nine o’clock. We entered it and
were off to London. The daylight journey was even
more pleasant than our festive night ride. I, who had
been so confined all my life, could see the beautiful and
varied scenery—the lakes and mountains of Northumberland;
the moors and forests of Yorkshire; the castles,
country seats, hamlets and farmhouses along the way.
And to me all this was novel and delightful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We reached London at nightfall. And there we
parted with Anglesea, who returned to Brighton to rejoin
his friends the Middlemoors.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As we were really very tired with our twenty-four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>hours of travel, without sleep, we went to the Norfolk
Hotel for the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The next day we spent in seeing some of the sights of
London, which I had never seen, and which, of course,
filled me with wonder and interest—indeed, all my life
since I had left Weirdwaste was marvelously changed
and enlarged, even as if I were born in a new world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The next morning we took the tidal train from London
Bridge and went down to Dover to meet the Calais
boat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘We will spend a month in Paris, my soul,’ said
Luigi to me, as we entered the train—‘a full month, no
less, my life.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘But have you not to go immediately to Italy?’ I
inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Oh, no; I am recalled—that is, I am permitted to
return, not commanded to do so,’ he explained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Oh, then I misunderstood you.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘And your estates, dear Luigi. Are they restored to
you?’ I next inquired, without one mercenary thought
in my heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes,’ he replied, with a curious smile. ‘Such as
they are, my love and life, they are restored to me.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What do you mean?’ I questioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘That they were not worth keeping from me, my
own. Yet, fear not. I am not without resources. We
shall spend a gay month in Paris.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so we did.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We reached that city the next morning and took
apartments at the ‘Splendide.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“If to my rustic mind Brighton had been a delight
Paris was now a rapture.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Is there,’ I asked of Luigi, after only one day’s experience
of the city—‘is there another place in all this
world so heavenly as Paris?’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“He looked at me a few seconds in silence, and then
replied, with more knowledge than his years could have
promised:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No, my soul! There is no place on this planet so
celestial, or so infernal, as is this city.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I stared at him in dismay.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Never fear, my love. You shall never see or hear
the infernos of the city.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“That day I took time to write to my father. I had
not an hour’s leisure during our mad journeys to do so
before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I told him all the circumstances and all the experiences
of outer and inner life that had driven me to
take my fate in my own hands and go away with Luigi
Saviola to be married. And I gave him all the details
of the journey and the ceremony. And I ended by imploring
him to forgive us both and to receive us on a
visit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After that act of duty, I plunged with Luigi into
all the gayeties of gay Paris, and saw no signs of the
‘infernos.’ Music, the drama, balls, excursions, these
filled up our days, for a month of mad rapture.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, about the middle of December, we went down
to Marseilles, and took a steamer to Naples, where we
arrived in health, spirits and safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had often questioned Luigi about his family, but
he told me he had none to speak of. He was an only
child; his father and mother were among the angels in
heaven. His uncle was a priest and missionary in
Brazil. His two aunts were nuns—one in a Benedictine
convent in France, the other in an Augustine sisterhood
in Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had questioned him about his home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He had described to me a half ruined and wholly
uninhabitable castle situated among the forest-covered
mountains of the wild Abruzzo.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“But oh! how I longed to go there! All my love of
the historic, the romantic, the picturesque was engaged
in that longing!</p>

<p class='c007'>“On our landing at Naples I proposed to go.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he told me that at this season of the year the
roads were so very bad as to render the journey impracticable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He took me to the ‘Vittoria,’ where we rested for a
few days.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here again I wrote to my father, telling him of my
first letter, which I feared had never reached him, and
repeating at length the story of my marriage, and the
plea for his pardon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I waited weeks for an answer before I gave up hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Naples did not offer many sources of amusement, but
we availed ourselves of all that was to be obtained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was during our sojourn in this city that I gradually
learned—what I was very unwilling to believe and
very deeply distressed to know—namely, the nature of
those resources of which Luigi had spoken to me; they
were the gaming tables, at which he was almost always a
successful player. My hero, and martyr, and patriot
was a gambler!</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a great grief, and I never really recovered
from it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He won large sums of money, and lavished gifts
upon me which gave me no pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“About the middle of February we went to Rome for
the carnival, for Lent was rather late this year.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, after the week of orgies, we still remained in
the ‘Eternal City’ until the end of March, that I might
see all its glories, and, ah me! not a few of its shames.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In April we went to Venice—the city of a hundred
isles. I thought I had seen the most marvelous and enchanting
things in the world, but here again wonder
upon wonder burst upon my amazed soul.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“Why should I go on writing all this like the index
of a guidebook?</p>

<p class='c007'>“You and I have gone over Europe together. You
know me, and may judge what it was to me the first
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me be brief now.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Luigi, wherever we went, pursued his profession,
and was never without ‘revenues.’ I looked in vain for
any sign of heroism, self-devotion or patriotism in him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sometimes in the cities we passed through, in the
public gardens, or the parlors of hotels, I heard questions
discussed which stirred my blood—questions of the
rights of man in all its ramifications—questions that
made my heart beat in sympathy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They never moved him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I wondered. Once I asked him if he really had
lost all interest in the welfare of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He shrugged his shoulders, and replied that he never
had felt any.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On another occasion, when I spoke of the elevation
of mankind, he answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘We are young. We are fair. We are healthy. We
are happy. Let us enjoy ourselves, and let mankind go
to Hades.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dark-eyed Luigi was neither hero nor martyr;
neither patriot nor humanitarian. He was only a beautiful
and joyous youth, bent on making the merriest of
every hour of life at cost of anybody else, except of himself
and me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, how I was disappointed in him! A broken idol
is a very sad event in the life of a romantic dreamer,
I fancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I began to try to remember how I had ever got the
idea that he was a patriot and a political refugee, and
the rest of it. And I recollected that it was from Anglesea
and from Madame de la Champe.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“He—Luigi—had never pretended to be anything but
my lover. And he was my lover still. He continued to
be my lover to the last of his short, young life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must pass on now to the tragedy of our marriage.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“We lived at the best hotels in every town and city
where we stopped, but we never stayed long at any place.
Saviola was too successful a gambler for that.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was always kind to me, and would have loaded
me with jewels and costly dress, but that I would have
none of them, for my soul was troubled by the way in
which he made his money—a way that he no longer tried
to conceal from me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had periodical fits of homesickness, during which
I wrote to my father and to my teachers, but without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>in any instance receiving a reply. Then I would write
again and again, with no better result. And finally I
would give up hoping to hear from them, and try to
resign myself to my fate; until my next attack of homesickness
would set my pen in motion again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Later on, not homesickness alone, but remorse and
despair and terror seized me. I was beginning to lose
all hope of ever being forgiven by my father; and, ah
me! I was also beginning to lose esteem for my husband,
for whose sake I had left all my friends and relations.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Luigi was still fond of me in that way that a child
is fond of a favorite toy of which he is not yet tired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had discovered my own self-deception.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Other young girls have come to grief and death
through their deception by others. I had only myself
to blame! Myself had only deceived me. But it was
bitter! oh, how bitter! to find out that the hero, martyr,
patriot and humanitarian I had imagined, was only a
very handsome young gambler, who was not too honest
or truthful!</p>

<p class='c007'>“My undeceived soul sickened at him and at myself!</p>

<p class='c007'>“My very last attack of homesickness found us at
Geneva, where we had an elegant suit of apartments in
the Hotel Beau Rivage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Again in one day I wrote five letters to absent
friends—to my father, to Miss Murray, to Madame de
la Champe, to Dr. Alexander, and to the Rev. Mr.
Clement. From some of these I should surely get an
answer. But week after week passed and no answer
came to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the second month after our arrival at Geneva,
Saviola was suddenly called to Paris—on imperative
business, he said; but I had learned to distrust. I could
not accompany him—my state of health utterly precluded
the idea of my traveling. He took a very affectionate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>leave of me, and promised to be back again
in a few days.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘A few days’ is a vague term! Yet I was not disturbed
by that. He left me, and I never saw his face
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just one week after he went away my child was born—a
boy. I was very healthy, and had a rapid convalescence,
notwithstanding the suspense and anxiety I
was suffering on account of my father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wrote to Luigi—to the address he had given me—and
informed him of the event. But I received no reply
to my letter. Yet, I got better every day, and I took
great comfort and delight in my child. Also, I daily
expected the return of Saviola to answer my letter in
person—for I remembered that he hated to write,
and was therefore one of the very worst correspondents
in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I was disappointed. Day followed day, week
succeeded week, and I neither saw nor heard from
Saviola, nor received any answers to any letter written
to my father and friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knew that my father must long have left the archipelago,
but I supposed that he must have—as usual—left
orders for any letters that might come for him after
his departure to be forwarded to his new address; so,
though I had expected delay, I had not anticipated final
disappointment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was now the first of October, and many tourists
were leaving the lake. Saviola had left me amply provided
with funds, so that I had no fear of embarrassment,
especially as I was very economical, only applying
the ill-gotten money to my barest necessities. Besides,
I had my boy, so that I was able to wait quite cheerfully
the return of my husband.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah me! It was not Saviola that I was troubled about.
It was my father. At length it occurred to me to write
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>to my father’s London bankers to inquire for him. And
I wondered that I had never thought of doing so before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On this occasion I received a prompt answer, which
was at once encouraging and depressing, as you will see,
contradictory as the statement seems. Messrs. Rhodes
told me that the earl had taken the countess to the Canaries
for her ladyship’s health, and that they had wintered
there, but that in May they had sailed for an extensive
yachting cruise, from which they were expected
to return to England some time in February.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So my father could never have received any of my
letters, and was therefore not the unbending, unforgiving,
pitiless father I had thought him. He had probably
written me many letters whose final destination was the
dead-letter office. I might still hope for his ready forgiveness.
So far the news was encouraging.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, then, on the other hand, he would not return
until February. This was the depressing feature in the
letter. Yet the encouraging circumstances outweighed
the depressing item, so that, on the whole, I was more
hopeful and more cheerful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As the days of October grew shorter and cooler I
began to be impatient to leave the place, and for this
reason eager for the return of Saviola. At length I
grew really despondent. It was about this time—the
middle of October—that I saw in the little Geneva paper
an item that startled and delighted me. It was under
the head of ‘Arrivals.’ It was but a line:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘The Hon. Angus Anglesea, England—Hotel des
Bergues.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Without an instant’s delay I sat down and wrote a
note, asking him to call on me at the Beau Rivage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The thought of meeting one home face—and that
the face of my brother’s dear friend, Saviola’s good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>friend, my own true friend, who had traveled with us
to Scotland to see that I should be regularly married
before he left me under the protection of Saviola—filled
my soul with delightful anticipations.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He came promptly in response to my summons. It
was only noon when the waiter opened the door of the
little drawing room where I sat, and announced:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘The Hon. Mr. Anglesea.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I sprang up and held out both my hands to welcome
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He raised one to his lips, bowed over it, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I hope I find you well, madame.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Oh! I am so glad—so glad to see you!’ I exclaimed,
at random.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He took a seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I sank into my easy chair, my heart beating with excitement,
with tumult, only to see the face of a friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I am very happy to come to you,’ he said. ‘I hope
Saviola is well,’ he added—dubiously, as I thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘He is always well,’ I replied. ‘He is in Paris.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You hear from him daily, of course?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No. He is a poor correspondent. I shall not hear
from him until I see him, I fear.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“He looked very grave, but made no comment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hastened to ask him if he knew where my father
then was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His reply confirmed the bankers news—the truth of
which, by the way, I had never doubted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He said that my father was wintering in the Canaries
for the sake of the countess’ health, and that Viscount
Glennon, my brother, was with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This was the reason, then, why I had never heard
from my brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Anglesea appeared preoccupied while he spoke.
Then, after a short silence, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“‘Ah, madame, pray do not consider me impertinent.
Believe me, I speak only in your own interests——’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘As you acted when you went to Scotland with us,’
I added.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Precisely, Madame la Princesse.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Then speak freely, Mr. Anglesea. I shall not take
offense.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Then I wish to inquire when you last heard from
Luigi Saviola.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hated to answer that question—to confess the many
days that had elapsed since I had seen or heard from my
husband. Yet I answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I have not heard from him since he left here for
Paris, six weeks ago.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Ah!’ he said, very gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘But I expect to see him soon,’ I added.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Indeed!’ he exclaimed, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes, indeed. Of course. Why not?’ I demanded,
in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was silent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Why not?’ I again demanded, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He looked grave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What do you mean, Mr. Anglesea?’ I exclaimed,
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Ah, madame!’ he sighed. ‘You know so little of
the world! So little of the world!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Mr. Anglesea, you distress me. Has anything happened
to Saviola?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Ah, madame, you were but a child when you went
off to marry the Italian. I—knowing full well that I
could not prevent that mad act which was sure to take
place—went with you, for your sake, for your brother,
my friend’s sake, to prevent any fatal error from being
committed. I thought I had prevented calamity to you.
I know better now. Ah, yes!’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“‘Mr. Anglesea,’ I said, ‘you frighten me. What has
happened? I implore you to tell me.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Not now! I cannot! But do not be alarmed!
Take courage! I am your friend! I will see you
through this trouble.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No! you must tell me—now! Has—has—has——’
I could scarcely bear to put the question; but I nerved
myself to do it. ‘Has Luigi left me—deserted me?’
And I sank back and covered my burning face with my
hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘How shall I answer your question, madame? But
put the question rather to your own intelligence. He
left here six weeks ago. He has not returned or written
to you since. Any one less youthful, innocent and inexperienced
than yourself would draw inferences from
these circumstances. Will you excuse me now? I will
see you this evening. May I?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes,’ I answered, mechanically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He bowed and left the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was alone again. I wished to be alone to collect
my thoughts. It had never occurred to me that Saviola
would desert me—never!</p>

<p class='c007'>“He had ceased to be my king, my hero, my idol.
He had revealed himself to be a gambler, a sharper, an
adventurer. I had long ceased to love, trust, or respect
him. Still, I knew that he was fond of me, in his way,
and so I never imagined that he could forsake me. And,
now that the possibility was presented to me, it filled me
with more wonder than sorrow or mortification.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was not nearly so much troubled by the possible
desertion of Saviola as I had been by the long silence
and fancied implacability of my father. I was sorry for
Saviola only because, though I had ceased to love, or
trust, or respect the man, I had begun to compassionate
him. He seemed so much weaker than I was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With this feeling of pity and regret was mingled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>one of intense relief. I had so little to lose in losing the
man whose life was a constant source of shame and fear
to me! But, whatever he may have been, his rank was
unquestionable. I had been lawfully married to him,
and I was the Princess Saviola. And my son was Prince
Rolando Saviola. No one could deprive us of these old
and honorable, though now empty, titles.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I soon reconciled myself to my desertion, even if I
did not rejoice in my deliverance. I made up my mind
to take my child and go directly to Weirdwaste, my own
inheritance from my mother, and there await my father’s
return to England; then confess the whole truth to him
and throw myself upon his love and his protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, ah, Heaven! I did not yet know the worst!”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXI<br> <span class='c005'>PRETENDED CONSOLATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“In the evening Anglesea called on me again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His manner was full of the most respectful sympathy.
He was my brother’s dearest friend. He had
acted in my father’s and my brother’s absence as my own
best friend; and, since he could not prevent my romantic
escapade, he had attended me in the character of a
guardian, to see that no fatal mistake was made through
Saviola’s ignorance of national laws and customs.
Therefore, I had every reason to trust in him and confide
in him as in an elder brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was alone, in the little drawing room, when he entered.
I received him as warmly, though more gravely,
than when he had called at noon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When we were seated I asked him—as I would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>asked my brother—whether my husband had really,
finally abandoned me.</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked searchingly into my face, as if to see how
I would be likely to take his answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finding in my expression no very distressing
anxiety, but simply a wish to know the truth, he replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Saviola has disappointed us all. If I were not
speaking to you I should say that he is scarcely worthy
of thought, still less of regret.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘But—are you sure? Has he really and finally
abandoned me?’ I repeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘He has.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You are sure of this?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I am.’</p>

<p class='c007'>His words and tones were grave, sweet and compassionate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Where is he now?’ I next inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘In Paris.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I must write to him again, then,’ I said, with the
idea that, although I no longer loved or respected the
man, he was my husband, and to write to him was my
duty. ‘I will—will write to him to-night.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You may do so,’ he said, gravely and tenderly.
‘Nay, I would even counsel you to do so for the relief
of your own mind, and that you may never have the
slightest cause for self-reproach. But I warn you that
it will have no effect whatever upon Saviola. He will
not answer your letter.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘He has not answered any letter of mine since he
left for Paris. But, surely, if I write and ask him,
plainly, whether he ever means to return to me, and beg
him to reply, so that I may know what to do, he will
answer.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No, he will not. But, to satisfy yourself, write to
him at once. Then you will know, Elfrida!’”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“In the days when we three—Anglesea, my brother
and myself were as intimate and familiar as the children
of one house—he had followed suit with Francis and
called me by my Christian name, and sometimes by its
abbreviation. I had liked it then, and I liked it now,
though this was the first time, since my marriage, that
he had given it to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes, I will write to-night. I will write at once,’ I
said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Then I will bid you good-evening. There is a mail
that closes at eleven o’clock. If I leave you now you
may be able to secure it,’ he said, rising.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Thank you, Angus. Come again to-morrow,’ I
said, using the name I had been accustomed to give him
when he was the daily and beloved companion of my
brother and myself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He took my hand, bowed over it and left the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I sat down to my desk to write the letter to
Saviola in Paris.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not reproach him, nor lament his absence, nor
write in any way unkindly or sorrowfully to him. I
simply reminded him how long he had been gone; how
many letters I had written that remained unanswered,
and then inquired whether he meant to return to me,
and if so, when? I ended by telling him that my little
son and myself were in good health, and begging him to
answer me to the point that I might know what to do.
So I left him at perfect liberty to act for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I had sealed and directed this letter I rang
and dispatched it to the hotel bag that left the house at
a quarter to eleven.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I went to bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My child usually slept with his nurse in a little room
off my bedchamber. But now I called her to bring the
baby to me; and I took him into bed and drew him to my
bosom, finding comfort in the thought that my child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>would never desert me, and that no one on earth had
power to take him from me. What a soothing balm
that little form was pressed to my heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I lay awake nearly all that night, not with trouble
or anxiety, but with thoughts and plans for the future
of my child and myself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had made up my mind. If I should get no answer
from Saviola I would make ready and leave Switzerland
for Ireland. I would go with my child to Weirdwaste,
which was my own, and live there as I had lived
before the fatal journey to Brighton. I would live
among my warm-hearted Irish tenants, who, poor as my
forefathers had been for generations, had never been oppressed,
but always helped to the extent of our power.
They had loved my mother, had loved me for her sake,
and they would now welcome and love my child, who
would be the heir of Weirdwaste, if of nothing more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would live at Weirdwaste until the return of my
father, when I would confess all my faults and follies
to him, and appeal to his affection for forgiveness and
protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In two years and a few months I should be of age,
and should enter into the full possession of my poor, old
estate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should live there always, and bring up my boy to
be a Christian gentleman and a good and wise landlord.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The excellent vicar should be his tutor and look
after his education, and the amiable doctor should be
his physician and look after his health.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Francis, my dear brother, would visit me often, I
felt sure. My father would come sometimes. These
were all I really cared to see.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We should be happy—my little son and I—in spite
of all that had passed. He would never, from his
father’s example, grow up to become a gambler, a wine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>bibber, or an adventurer. He should be trained to become
an honor to his name and a blessing to his tenantry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thinking these pleasant thoughts I fell asleep at last
and realized all my anticipations—in my dreams!</p>

<p class='c007'>“The next day, and every day for a week, Angus
Anglesea came to see me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He no longer spoke of Saviola; but he talked to me
of my dear brother, his own dearest friend—a theme
of which I never tired. He told me that his ardent
studies at Eton had overtasked his strength. His physicians
recommended a long vacation, and a total change
of air and scene. Therefore, he accompanied his father
and stepmother to the Canaries—Dr. Alexander and the
Rev. Dr. Clement, of Weirdwaste, attending the party,
as traveling physician and private tutor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘So,’ said I, ‘that is the reason why none of my letters
addressed to my old friends at Weirdwaste were
ever answered. But since the vicar and the doctor were
conscripted for foreign service, who, may I ask, was
left to take charge of the souls and bodies of the poor
people at Weirdwaste?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My child, clergymen and physicians are as plenty
as wild berries. A curate without a parish and a doctor
without a practice were easily found to fill the places of
the hard-worked and badly paid old vicar and doctor,
who needed rest and change about as much as any of the
traveling party.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘So all my friends are in the Canaries!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Except myself, Elfrida. I am here, and I will remain
near you, to guard you as an elder brother, until
your fate is decided.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘A girl’s fate is supposed to be decided when she is
married, but that does not take into account the possibility
of her desertion by her husband,’ I replied, but
without any bitterness of feeling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No,’ he admitted, very gravely—‘no, because such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>possibilities are as exceptional as they are tragical. But
take courage, Elfrida. As I was your brother’s truest
friend and brother, so I will be yours, to remain near
you, to guard you and assist you as long as you may
need me.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Thank you, Angus! Oh, thank you! I am glad
that all my family and friends are in the Canaries, since
it is so good for them to be there. And I am glad—oh!
so glad that you are here, Angus! I do not feel quite
alone and helpless now that you are here. It is very
good of you to say that you will remain near me until
something is settled. But will not your doing so interfere
with some of your previous engagements?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Not with any,’ he replied. ‘I am an idle man.
And even if it were not so—even if I were over head and
ears in business—I should let all go in order to be of
service to my dear friend’s sister in her need. And believe
me, Elfrida, I find the greatest happiness in serving
you.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“His generous devotion moved me to tears. I
thanked him in the most earnest words at my command.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The week passed, and no letter came from Saviola.
I was not disappointed, for now I scarcely expected to
get one. I reconciled myself to my fate as a forsaken
wife all the more cheerfully for my child’s sake, who
would be thus saved from the baleful effects of his
father’s evil example.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The week passed, and though no letter came from
Saviola, no word on the subject was spoken between
Anglesea and myself.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“Anglesea watched me closely, as if in anxiety to
see how much this suspense and uncertainty might affect
my health and spirits. And I think he was surprised
and pleased to discover that I was not distressed by the
situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was on the eighth day after my letter had been
dispatched that the subject of that letter was first mentioned.
It was I who first spoke of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anglesea came in to make his usual morning call.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After our greetings were over, and we had sat down,
I said to him:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘It is now more than a week since I wrote to Saviola.
I have now no longer the faintest hope of receiving
an answer to my letter. I shall not wait here longer.
I shall leave Geneva to-morrow.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I never supposed for a moment that you would
ever hear from him again. I knew, in fact, that it was
impossible for you to do so; but I wished you to prove
the question to yourself,’ he gravely replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You knew it! I thought that you inferred it!’ I
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My inference amounted to moral conviction; moral
conviction to positive knowledge.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not answer him. I scarcely understood him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What do you propose to do, Elfrida?’ he inquired,
gravely and tenderly taking my hand, and then adding:
‘Whatever it may be, you see me here ready to stand by
you, to counsel and assist you to the utmost of my
ability.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Oh! I thank you, Angus!—I thank you with all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>my heart and soul! You are indeed a friend and brother
raised up to me in the time of need!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I see—I hope I see clearly—that you are wasting
no vain regrets on the man who is unworthy of your
thoughts,’ he said, with a strange look that puzzled me,
coming from him. I cannot define the look; I had
never seen such a one on his face before, and it troubled
me; I answered him:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I am not grieving as you see; but we will not talk
of Saviola; he is my husband after all, you know.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Ah!’ he said, in a sort of equivocal tone that again
disturbed me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What shall you do now, Elfrida?—after leaving
Geneva, I mean?’ he next inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I shall go at once to England, cross over to Ireland,
and take up my abode at Weirdwaste, where I lived so
long before that fatal visit to Brighton.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘To—Weirdwaste!’ he exclaimed, in some surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes. It is a poor old manor, but it is my own
property in right of my mother, and I shall come into
full possession of it as soon as I am of age.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘But—to that wild, dreary, solitary home, where
you spent so many lonely, secluded, unhappy years. And
of which you complained to your brother and myself so
bitterly?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes. It seemed all that you have described it to be
to my wilful and impatient childhood and youth, when
I longed to see and know the world. I have seen and
known enough, and more than enough, of the world, and
now my thoughts turn to Weirdwaste and its quiet life
as a haven of rest.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My poor Elfrida! You would wear your young
heart out in such a solitude!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No; I would not. I should have my child to occupy
and interest me; and I shall have the poor on the
estate to look after.’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“‘These duties could not fill your heart, Elfrida.
You would languish into melancholia or death. Listen,
Elfrida—dearest Elfrida! You talked of that wild seacoast
manor house as a haven of rest. It would not be
so. It would be to you as a desert, a prison, an exile.
See, Elfrida! Here is your true haven of rest!’ he said,
bending toward me with a look that sent all the blood
rushing to my head and face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What do you mean? Where?’ I cried, in alarm,
though I did not understand his meaning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Here!’ he exclaimed, striking his breast and then
extending both hands toward me—‘Here! in my love!—in
my arms!—in my bosom! Oh, Elfrida! accept the
life’s devotion of one who adores you, and who will
gladly consecrate all his days to your happiness!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could no longer misunderstand him; nor could I
speak for amazement and indignation. He took advantage
of my silence to pour out the malebolge of his
revolting passion before me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At last, with a great effort, I conquered the speechless
panic into which his insults had thrown me, and
my wrath and shame burst forth in strong and fiery
words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I ordered him from my presence; but he did not go.
I called him hard names—a snake in the grass—a wolf
in sheep’s clothing, a traitor, a hypocrite.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He did not reply; he stood up before me and took it
all, devouring me with his eyes, while his tongue was
silent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At length, my paroxysm of violence broke down in
tears, and I wept in bitter anguish.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Although I am forsaken, yet still I am a wife!’ I
said; ‘though my husband has left me, yet still he is my
husband.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“These words gave him the opportunity he now
wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“I had sunk down in my chair and covered my face
with my hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He came up to me, laid his hand on the back of my
chair, and dropping his voice to the lowest tones of
reverential sympathy, he said these terrible words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No, Elfrida! No, my poor child! It breaks my
heart to tell you the truth, that I have only recently
learned to my dismay; but you must hear it sooner or
later. Better to hear it kindly, tenderly told by a
friend’s tongue than harshly and suddenly by a wordling’s
or an enemy’s. No, Elfrida! You are no wife.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Saviola is dead, then!’ I exclaimed, in an access of
excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No, Elfrida; that is not what I mean. You are
no wife, because—you never have been.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I lifted my head and gazed on him in dumb horror
and amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He met my look with one of deepest sorrow and
commiseration.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘It is false!’ I cried, as soon as I could speak. ‘It
is foully, cruelly false!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I would to Heaven it were!’ he sighed. ‘I would
to Heaven it were!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was something in his look and tone that
seemed to force truth and despair into my soul. Had
my marriage ceremony been unlawful, notwithstanding
Anglesea’s pretended carefulness? Or what had happened?
How had I been betrayed? I struggled not to
believe him—not to question him; but I could not help
doing both.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Why do you say such—such——’ I had no word
strong enough to utter my thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He answered me as if I had done so:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Because I must, Elfrida. I came to Geneva for
that purpose. I came from Saviola, charged with a
message to you.’ He ceased.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“‘Go on,’ I said. ‘Go on,’ I was at that moment
almost insane. It took all my power of self-control to
keep still.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I met him in Paris two weeks ago. He told me that
he was on the eve of marriage with Mademoiselle de la
Villemonte, daughter of the Duc de la Villemonte; that
he had not the courage to write and break his connection
with you, especially as such writing would be dangerous.
It might bring you on to Paris to try to prevent it,
which would be awkward. So, he prayed me to take
his farewell message to you. I will not insult you, Elfrida,
by giving his message.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes! Give it! Do not spare me!’ I cried out in
my agony.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Then it was to the effect that he was obliged by
circumstances to part with you, but that as soon as he
could command the fortune he was to receive with
Mademoiselle de la Villemonte, he would make a suitable
provision for you and your child.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You heard him say that? You, my brother’s
friend! And you did not slay him on the spot!’ I cried,
with all my blood on fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My dear Elfrida, my scorn, contempt and indignation
might have led me to knock the villain down and
trample him to death. But, my child, we are all living
in civilized Europe and in the nineteenth century, and
our education teaches us to subdue the wild beast that
is within us. Besides, I had you to think of. If I
should slay Saviola and be cast into prison, who would
take care of you? Your father and brother, even your
old pastor and doctor, were away in the Canaries, and
you had not a friend in the world near you.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘And I have not now!’ I cried, in bitter despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Do not say that, Elfrida. I lay my life at your
feet!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No more of that! Your every word insults me!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>And you could come here with a false face and let me
write to that man and never tell me what you have only
told me now!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My dear Elfrida! Could I burst upon you suddenly
with news that, for aught I then knew, might
have killed you on the spot, or maddened you for life?
No, none but a brute could have done so. I had to feel
my way; to lead you slowly up to the truth; to
strengthen you to bear it. That is why I allowed you to
write to Saviola and to wait for a letter from him.
That is why I watched your every tone and look. While
doing so I perceived that your happiness did not depend
on your union with Saviola.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Tell me this!’ I burst out, almost furiously. ‘How
was it that you, who went ostensibly to guard me against
misadventure, became accessory to some deception which
rendered that marriage rite performed between me and
Saviola of no legal effect? Tell me this, oh, traitor and
hypocrite!’”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXIII<br> <span class='c005'>HOW IT HAPPENED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“‘My dearest Elfrida, for my beastly stupidity I deserve
all the reproaches you can heap upon me. But
not the utter reproach of complicity in the deception
that was practiced upon you. I never suspected Saviola
of a design to deceive you. But the Italian was too deep
for me. I went to insure you against mistake, not deception.
But, as I say, the Italian was too deep for me.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What do you mean?’ I cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Saviola had studied the route to Scotland, with the
design to deceive you. There were two stations on that
route of similar names. One was Kelton, in Northumberland.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>The other was Kilton, in Scotland. Saviola
took tickets for us all to Kelton, when he made us believe
that they were for Kilton. We went by the night
train, you remember. We got out at Kelton, near the
border on the English side, believing all the time that it
was Kilton, on the Scottish side. There, in England,
you were married regularly enough; but because it was
in England, and you were a minor marrying without
the consent of your parents or guardians, therefore the
marriage was illegal, null and void.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Did Saviola tell you this when you met in Paris?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes, but I had discovered the fact, to my great dismay
and distress, before that.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘When, and how?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘In September I was going up to Scotland for a
week’s shooting. I went by the same train that had
carried us, but in the daytime. When we stopped at
Kelton I recognized the station at which we had got out,
the hotel where we had stopped for breakfast, and the
distant church, with the manse beside it, where the marriage
ceremony had been performed. And yet I knew
then—as I had not known on that fatal night—that we
had not crossed the border.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Then we were married in England?’ I wailed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes! To settle the point, I asked a fellow passenger
how far we were from the Scottish border. He
told me just five miles. Still, I did not then suspect
Saviola of having wilfully betrayed us. I thought he
had confused the two—Kelton and Kilton—and had
made a fatal mistake. And I cursed my own stupidity
in not having foreseen and prevented it. I determined
to seek you both out and have the mistake rectified by
another and a regular marriage ceremony as soon as
possible. I did not know where to find you, nor of
whom to inquire for you, since your friends were all
in the Canary Islands. It was by accident only that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>met him in Paris, and learned the truth from his own
lips, as I have already told you.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“He ceased to speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Overwhelmed as I was I tried to make some little
stand for my own dignity and self-respect. I said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘The marriage—in spite of quibbles—was a marriage
in the sight of God, if not in the sight of man.
The good old minister who pronounced the nuptial benediction
over two young people who—at that time, at
least, loved each other, and who were free to wed—married
us as lawfully, as sacredly as all the united state
and church could have married us! Repudiated and
abandoned as I may be, I am still the wife of Luigi
Saviola. And I will be true to myself. Though he has
sacrilegiously wedded another woman, he is still my
husband, and I will be faithful to him.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had by this time recovered my self-possession, and
felt some regret at the paroxysm of emotion into which
I had been thrown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Elfrida,’ he said, ‘this is sheer fatuity. You have
no more right to call yourself the wife of Prince Saviola
than you have to call yourself the consort of the czar.
You are not a wife. You are free—free to accept the
love and devotion that I lay at your feet.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I felt my heart rising again in wrath. I did not
wish again to lose my self-control. I commanded myself,
and, with forced calmness and some sarcasm, inquired:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Do I understand you to be offering me marriage
Mr. Anglesea?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“He took his hand from the back of my chair, over
which he had been leaning, and walked away with a
look of petulance and annoyance. Presently he returned
to my side, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Dearest Elfrida, men do not offer marriage under
these circumstances.’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“I turned and looked him straight in the face as I
demanded:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What, then, is it that you do offer your friend’s
sister?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“He winced slightly, but answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘All that a man may offer—under the circumstances—love,
devotion, protection. My heart and my
fortune. The use of my country seat and town house
until—ahem!—such settlements as may secure your
future from want. Elfrida, hear me!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“And again he poured forth a torrent of insults,
which pretended to be love, admiration, adoration—what
you will, but which were gross insults. When he
had talked himself out of breath I only answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Mr. Anglesea, you have offended me beyond hope
of pardon. Leave my presence at once, and never dare
to enter it again.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“He did not go, but stood there and recommenced his
insulting suit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I went and put my hand upon the bell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Will you leave the room, or shall I call the people
of the house to put you out?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Neither, Elfrida. You will hear me,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I pulled the cord, and with such effect that a servant
quickly entered the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Show this gentleman out,’ I said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The man bowed and held the door open.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Thanks, Fritz. I can find my own way. You
needn’t wait,’ said Anglesea, with cool insolence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The man bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anglesea turned to me with a smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quick as lightning I formed a resolution and acted
upon it. I darted through the door leading into my
bedroom, closed it behind me, and shot the bolt to secure
myself. I heard him laugh as I dropped breathless
into a chair.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“‘What is it, madame?’ inquired the nurse, who was
seated beside my sleeping baby’s crib.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Nothing,’ I answered. And the girl, seeing that
I did not mean to be questioned, became silent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Soon I heard Anglesea leave the room and walk
downstairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A little later on I rang again and gave orders that
if the gentleman who had just gone out came again, he
was not to be admitted to my apartments.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I began my preparations for leaving Geneva.
I clung with all my heart and soul and strength to the
conviction that my marriage was sacred. Saviola and
myself were both single when we married. The venerable
minister of God who united us was most solemnly
in earnest when he performed the rites and gave us his
benediction. We were married, and no subsequent
nuptials of Saviola could affect that undeniable fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yet—though I felt so sure of the reality and sanctity
of our marriage, I was resolved never under any
circumstances to be reunited with Saviola so long as a
doubt of the fact remained on my mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would go, as I had planned, to Weirdwaste, and
live there with my child, retaining my marriage name
and title for the boy’s sake as well as for my own.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I made such progress with my preparations that
they were completed by nightfall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anna, my Swiss nursemaid, agreed to go with me to
England and remain with me until I could supply her
place, when I would pay her expenses back to Geneva.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After my tea was over that evening, and as Fritz
went out with the service, I told him to bring my bill,
and have it include the night’s lodging and the next
morning’s breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He left to do my errand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In half an hour he returned, followed by some one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>with a firm footstep. I thought it was Anglesea, and
flushed with indignation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘A gentleman to see madame,’ said the waiter,
throwing open the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Did I not forbid you——’ I began, but stopped
suddenly and aghast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was my father who stood before me.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXIV<br> <span class='c005'>FATHER AND DAUGHTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, it was my father who stood before me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was dressed in deep mourning, and he looked
older by twenty years than when I had seen him last.
As I gazed on his worn face, on which there was no
trace of anger, but only sorrow—I was suddenly smitten
with remorse for all I had done to him; wrongs of which
I never realized the enormity until now.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The cry of the prodigal son rose in agony to my lips:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Father! forgive me!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“He opened his arms, and I threw myself within
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He folded me to his bosom in sorrow too deep for
words, yet I felt that I was forgiven as I sobbed on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After a few minutes he lifted my head, kissed me,
and led me to the sofa.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I had dropped upon the cushion he sat down
beside me, put his arm protectingly around me, and
then he spoke for the first time:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘It is I who need forgiveness—I who left my poor,
motherless little girl for long years to the care of hirelings
and eye servants, who betrayed their trust and left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>her an easy prey to villainy. Yes, it is I who need forgiveness.
Elfrida, my child, can you forgive me?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Oh, father! father! do not speak so to me—to me
who sinned against you so grievously—to me who ought
to be on my knees at your feet!’ I said. And in the
excess of remorse that his patient, forgiving words inspired,
I would have kneeled to him, but that he stopped
me and drew me again to his bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We spoke no more to each other for a few moments.
At last he said, in a broken voice:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Did you know—your poor stepmother—was dead,
Elfrida?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I thought so, from your mourning dress, papa. I
am very sorry for you,’ I replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘She passed away in the Canaries, five weeks since.
I have the comfort of knowing that everything which
human power could do was done for her. I devoted the
last twelve years of my life solely to her, going with her
wherever there was any hope for benefit. And for this
cause I left my poor motherless child exposed to the
beasts of prey that infest this world.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Father, dear father, say nothing more of that. I
am alive, and since you have forgiven me, I am almost
happy again. Dear father, let us live for each other
now. I will be the most loving, the most faithful, devoted
daughter that ever parent had. I will live for you,
father. Only for you—and—and—for my child—my
boy.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Your child, Elfrida!’ he said, staring at me, while
a shiver passed through his frame.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes, the child of my wilful, unfortunate marriage,
dear father. I wrote and told you all about my marriage,
but I fear you never got my letter.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No,’ he said, with a visible effort to recover from
the shock he had received; ‘no. I heard of your marriage
from other sources, and not until I returned to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>England, three weeks ago, with the remains of my wife
for interment in the vault at Enderby Castle. The
news met me there—terrible news to meet a father coming
home to bury his wife.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Oh, my father! Oh, my father! Can you forgive
me?’ I cried out, at this.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I could not forgive myself, child. I never dreamed
of blaming you. Does any one blame the bird that is
snared?’ he tenderly inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You are too merciful to me—too merciful. I do
not deserve it,’ I said, covering my face with my hands,
for my father’s kind words pierced my heart like
poniards.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Hush, child; hush. Do not reproach yourself so
bitterly. Let me tell you how it was that I did not
receive any tidings of your marriage until my return
to England.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I know, dear father. It was because you were far
away in the Canaries.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘That was not all, my child. Listen. While I was
still in the archipelago, late in October, I received a
batch of letters from England, all bringing me good
news of my son and daughter. There was one from
you, telling me of your fully restored health and good
spirits, and your desire to spend the winter at Brighton.
Another from Miss Murray, giving a very flattering account
of your progress in education. A third was from
Madame de la Champe, much to the same effect.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Those letters were written only three days before
my hasty marriage, and, oh! believe me, papa, because
I even dreamed of taking such a hasty step,’ I earnestly
declared.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘I do believe you, my child. You shall explain
later. The same mail brought me a long letter from
your brother, who had gone to Eton. He told me of
his long summer vacation spent with you at Brighton.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>And he corroborated the intelligence given by yourself
and your governess as to your health, good spirits and
rapid progress. He also asked leave to spend the Christmas
holidays with you at Brighton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here I sighed so heavily that my father stopped,
and laid his hand on mine in sympathy, while he resumed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘All these letters gave me great satisfaction, on account
of my dear children. They were especially comforting
to me at that time, as I was about to leave the
archipelago for the Canaries. I did not notice then that
Glennon had omitted to say one word about his own
health, which was always delicate, he having inherited
the constitution of his mother.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘He looked well when he left Brighton,’ I ventured
to say.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes; but he did not continue well after resuming
his studies. The same mail that brought me his letter
brought one from one of the physicians at Eton. I had
overlooked all my other correspondence in dwelling upon
the letters from my children; but at length I took up
one in a strange handwriting which, on opening, proved
to be from the physician who had been attending my
son for some seemingly slight disorder in his health.
This Dr. Fletcher wrote to me to say that the state of
my son’s health was such that Glennon should leave Eton
and have a thorough change of air, scene and diet. He
suggested that he should have a traveling tutor, and go
to a warmer and drier climate.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I had heard that he went with you to the Canaries,’
I said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes,’ continued my father, ‘I quickly made up my
mind in regard to Glennon. I wrote to my two old
friends, Dr. Alexander and the Rev. Mr. Clement, asking
them if they could procure substitutes to fill their
places at Weirdwaste, and accompany us to the Canaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>for the winter—the one to take charge of the young viscount’s
health, and the other to direct his studies in a
very moderate manner.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I heard, too, that the doctor and the vicar joined
your party,’ I said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes; though I scarcely ventured to hope that they
would. And really I was as much surprised as pleased
when I received letters from them accepting my offer
and promising—according to my request, in case of their
acceptance—to go to Eton, join my son and accompany
him to Gibraltar, and there await the arrival of our
steamer.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father paused for a few moments, looked at me
remorsefully, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I little knew how I was about to leave my dear, only
daughter; my poor, motherless girl! We sailed early
in November. But before sailing I answered your letter
and those of your teachers, expressing the great satisfaction
I felt in your improved health and good progress,
thanking your teachers for all their—supposed—zeal
and care, and telling you that you should winter at
Brighton while we were at the Canaries.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Oh! I never saw that letter, father! I had gone
on my mad journey before that letter came!’ I said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I know it now, my dear! I did not know it then,
when I said in cheerful confidence that I had left you
so safe and happy. At Gibraltar your brother, with the
vicar and the doctor, joined us; and in a few days we
sailed for Santa Cruz de Teneriffe. Where were you
then, my dear?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I was in Paris—anxiously waiting for an answer
to the letter I had written you, announcing my marriage
and asking your forgiveness.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘A letter which I missed by leaving the Grecian
Archipelago before it arrived.’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“‘And, oh, how long, in my ignorance—how long I
waited and hoped to hear from you!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘As I waited and hoped to hear from you—not
understanding your silence. After we had been some
weeks settled at Santa Cruz, I began to be seriously uneasy
at not hearing from you, as I had especially requested
you, in my last letter, to direct your answer to
Santa Cruz de Teneriffe. But the countess urged that
you would probably wait to hear of our arrival before
writing. Then I wrote to you and waited for an answer;
none came. Then I wrote to the postmaster at
Brighton for information, and in due time received an
answer that your whole party had left the town, without
leaving any directions at the post office where letters
should be forwarded. This I attributed to carelessness
on your teachers’ part and inexperience on yours.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I left too suddenly and too madly to have thought
of such a provision—and I know not how my governesses
left after they discovered my flight.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I know how they left, but I did not learn until
later. From the postmaster’s imperfect information I
judged that you had returned to Weirdwaste. There
I addressed my next letters, with no more success than
had attended all the others. I received no answer. I
was uneasy, but not anxious. I thought that you were
living under the care of your teachers at Weirdwaste.
And I hoped, from week to week, to hear from you, and
ascribed my disappointment to any other cause than the
real one—to negligence, to irregular mails, and so forth.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘And all that time I was going from city to city
with my husband, leaving always directions where my
letters should be forwarded, and hoping always to hear
from you.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Ah, well, my dear, we were at cross-purposes without
knowing it. The summer came, but brought no increase
of health to my poor wife. She grew worse, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>my great anxiety on her account began to absorb all
my thoughts. I ceased even to look for a letter from
England.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I understand, dear father; the present and real
calamity dulled your sensibilities to imaginary troubles.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘In a measure and for a time; but at length I wrote
to the steward at Weirdwaste to ask why I did not hear
from you or your teachers. But, ah! before there was
time for an answer to return my poor wife died, and
I got ready to bring her remains to England.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My dear father!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I took the casket first to Enderby, where, having
been previously embalmed, it lay in state in the drawing
room. The funeral was advertised for the eighth day
after the arrival of the body, and I used the interval in
going quietly down to Liverpool and taking steamer to
Ireland en route for Weirdwaste, to fetch my daughter
on to Enderby for the funeral. It was at Weirdwaste
that the news of your marriage first met me.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Oh, father! But you have pardoned me! And so
they knew nothing of it at Enderby?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No, my dear. Consider the remoteness of each of
these seats from the busy world, and their distance from
each other—Enderby on the northwest coast of Northumberland—Weirdwaste
on the west coast of Ireland.
No, my dear, no hint of your marriage had reached
Enderby, nor would it ever have reached Weirdwaste
but for one circumstance.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘And that, my father?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Was the fact of your oldest governess, Miss Murray,
having left a portion of her effects at Weirdwaste.
The old lady wrote to the steward, telling him of your
sudden marriage, and of the consequent cessation of her
services, and requesting him to forward her effects—of
which she inclosed a list—to a certain address in London.
Though the steward and the housekeeper both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>wrote to the governess—when they sent her boxes—imploring
her to give them more particulars of their beloved
young lady, she gave them none, merely saying in
the letter in which she acknowledged the receipt of her
property that you had married and had gone away—more
than that she said she knew nothing.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I bowed my head in sorrow. I realized what my
dear, stricken father must have felt to hear such news
at such a time. But I know he never, even in thought,
reproached me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I made every inquiry, but could learn no more at
Weirdwaste. I went back to Northumberland—to Enderby—and
remained until after the funeral of my dear
wife. Then I went down to Brighton to make inquiries
there. I found the house where you had lodged—to
which all my letters had been directed—but the landlady
could tell me nothing more than that the young
lady had been missed one day, and that at the end of the
same week the two old ladies had given up their apartments
and had gone to London. And that, subsequently,
she had heard a report that the young lady had gone off
to Scotland, with “the Italian,” to be married; but she
did not know the truth of the matter.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I do not know how the report could have got out,
except through my teachers.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Of course it was through them. When I could hear
no more I went up to London to transact some business
with my banker. I did not like to ask any direct questions
of him concerning you; nor did I have any strong
hope of hearing news of you in that quarter. Nevertheless,
when our accounts had been overhauled, I did
venture to remark:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘“My daughter has not drawn on you of late, I perceive.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘“Not for a year,” he said; “and that reminds me,”
he continued, “that I had a letter from her highness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>last summer, inquiring your lordship’s address—I believe
it was from Geneva. I cannot lay my hands on it
at this time, but—yes, I am sure it was from Geneva.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘How glad I am that I wrote that letter! The banker’s
prompt reply was the first clew I got to your whereabouts,
as the banker’s news was the first clew you got
to mine.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes, my dear. I did not ask a question, burning as
I was to hear more of you. How could I ask that comparative
stranger for information respecting my daughter,
with whose movements I should have been perfectly
familiar? I did not even know why he called you “her
highness.” I left England that same afternoon, and
came as fast as steam could bring me to Geneva. Here
I am! But I do not even know the name of your husband.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Again I dropped my head upon my breast. I had so
much to tell him, besides the name of my husband. But
he was waiting patiently for my reply. I gave it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes, dear father,’ I answered, wondering at the
emotion, or rather at the panic, into which my words
had thrown him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Oh, my poor child! Oh, my dear child! And here
you have been controlling and concealing your own great
sorrow to listen to me and to sympathize with my lighter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>ones. Oh, my poor Elfrida! My poor, poor girl!’ he
breathed at last, with a voice full of distress and compassion
that I felt sure he must have heard of Saviola’s
Parisian marriage, and was grieving over it more than
I was for myself. I felt that I must try to comfort him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Do not take it to heart, dear father,’ I said. ‘Look
at me! I do not appear to be dying of despair, do I?
Do not grieve for me, since I do not grieve for myself.
Let us, from time to time, live for each other. You,
dear, dear father! have had a great sorrow which you
bear like a Christian. I have had a humiliating disappointment
and a wholesome lesson; though like most of
the teachings of experience, the lesson comes too late to
do the pupil any good. But from this time I will forget
my trouble and live for you.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was still staring at me with more wonder and
amazement than before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I had not the remotest suspicion that it was Luigi
Saviola whom you had married,’ he murmured, as if
speaking to himself. Then after another long, speculating
look at me, he inquired:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Elfrida, my darling, how came you to marry this
young man—was your act a mere whim, a childish
freak, or could you really have loved him?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I saw by his whole manner that there was some
afterthought in my father’s mind that I did not comprehend;
but I answered him:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I thought I loved him; but in my ignorance and
inexperience I must have been misled by fancy and
imagination to mistake admiration and enthusiasm for
love; but the hallucination was strong enough to make
me forget every duty I should have remembered and
held sacred.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Tell me all about your courtship and marriage, Elfrida!’
he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then I told him, as faithfully as I have set it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>down here for you, Abel, every particular—of Saviola’s
introduction to me; of the growth of our acquaintance
and its development into that false hero-worship which
I mistook for love; of our runaway marriage, in which
Angus Anglesea aided as my guardian, saying that since
he had no power to prevent the marriage he would see
that it was solemnized legally and properly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘God bless the boy!’ broke in my father, with so
much fervor that I had not heart to tell him afterward
what a villain Anglesea had proved himself—in the
sequel—to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I told him of our travels; of my letters of contrition
to him; of my disappointments in not hearing
from him; of the gradual opening of my eyes to the true
character of my husband; of my grief, wonder and
humiliation at discovering that my imaginary hero, martyr,
patriot, humanitarian, was no better than a professional
gambler and adventurer! Still, though his life
degraded himself and me, though I could no longer
adore and worship him as I had done when I believed
in him—still I bore with him because I really thought
that he loved me, that with all his faults he was faithful
to me. In this belief I lived and hoped until the end
came. Then, indeed, the last scales fell from my eyes.
I know that if he had ever loved me, he had ceased to do
so now.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Poor fellow!’ murmured my father, as if he judged
Saviola much more leniently than I could do. And
again the impression came to me that there was an afterthought
lurking in his mind, incomprehensible to mine.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Why do you pity him, father dear? I should think
you would feel nothing but resentment and animosity to
him.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My dear, when one has seen so much suffering as I
have, one must learn mercy. He ran away with my
daughter and married her, to be sure; but he was young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>and in love, and you were living only with careless
governesses. I could have forgiven him. He took to
the gaming table until hazard became the passion of his
life. He was lucky in cards, but I never heard that he
was dishonest. And—without knowing his near relations
to you and myself—I have heard a good deal of
him lately.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Father, you seem to be really defending him.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Am I, my dear? Then it is because he can no
longer defend himself.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No; for his conduct is utterly indefensible.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What conduct, my child?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My dear father, with all that you have heard of
him lately, you cannot have heard of the shocking event
at Paris.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes, my dear, I have heard it all—though I did
not know at the time that he was your husband.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘And now that you do know it, what do you think
of all this, sir?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I think, my dear, that it is strange in you, and incomprehensible
to me, that you should feel no regret
for the young man’s tragic fate, nor wear one sign of
mourning for him who was your husband. I think, my
dear, that in this you should pay some respect to death,
if not to the dead,’ he gravely replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was now my turn to stare at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Father!’ I exclaimed; ‘I do not comprehend. What
tragic fate? Who is dead? Not Luigi! I heard of
him only yesterday!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Heard of him? Heard of whom? Not Saviola?
Is it possible that you do not know?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Know what, sir? I know nothing, it seems. What
do you mean, dear father?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Is it possible that you do not know Prince Luigi
Saviola fell in a duel with the Duc de Montmeri, nearly
two months ago!’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>“‘Great Heaven! No, I knew nothing of all that.
Oh, poor Luigi! Poor Luigi!’ I covered my face with
my hands and fell back in my chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘And you knew nothing of all this?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Nothing, nothing!’ I moaned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘And yet the papers were full of the subject.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I never saw any papers after Luigi left me. I
was expecting my child every day, and I lived very
secluded, so that I heard no rumors—until very lately
a report met me that he was on the eve of marriage with
a French heiress,’ I said, remembering the tale told me
by Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Strange that such a report as that should get afloat
about a young man whose fate was well known all over
Europe, and filled all hearers with compassion and sympathy.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Tell me of the duel, father! Tell me all you know,’
I said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘It arose at a gentlemen’s dinner, given by one of
the Bonapartes. The talk turned on women, and drifted
into the comparative merits of women of different European
nationalities. The Duc de Montmeri, who had
taken too much wine, made some injurious and sneering
remarks on Italian women. The prince warmly took up
the defense of his fair compatriots. High words ensued.
The quarrel ended in the challenge of Saviola by Montmeri.
They met the next morning in a secluded spot in
the Rouveret. Montmeri was a professional duelist and
a dead shot. Saviola fell at the first fire. It was a murder—no
less. When his second went to raise his head
the dying man only breathed forth three words—“My
poor wife”—and died. Little did I think when I read
these words that the poor wife in question was my own
daughter.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Oh, Luigi! Poor Luigi! And to think that I
should have listened to such cruel slanders of you and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>cherished such bitter thoughts of you!’ I exclaimed, in
sudden remorse at the remembrance of the ready credence
I had given to the story of his second marriage
told me by Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘And you really knew nothing of this fatal duel
until I told you about it?’ again demanded my father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Nothing, I assure you. But remember how secluded
I have lived here, seeing no one but my infant
boy, my nurse and my maid—except, indeed, my physician,
who came daily for weeks, but who would not have
been likely to speak to me of the duel, even if he had
read of it, which he might not have done, you know.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Well, my love, you should now put on widow’s
mourning for your deceased husband,’ said my father,
looking gravely into my face.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXVI<br> <span class='c005'>“TELL ME ALL”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“‘I am not sure that I have the right to do so,’ I answered,
dropping my head on my bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You do not know whether you have any right to do
so? What do you mean, Elfrida? Are we still at cross-purposes,
my dear? Or what new enigma is this?’ he
demanded, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Father, I fear that a fatal mistake was made in the
manner of our marriage. I fear that mistake may render
it illegal. I will have no concealments from you.
Therefore, I must tell you even this. Once I was led
to believe that Saviola made no mistake, but purposely
left the train with me, on the English side of the border,
where our marriage without your consent would have
been unlawful; but now since I have learned that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>report of this French marriage was false, I now believe
that the report of his wilful deception of me in regard to
the place of our marriage was also false, and that he
ignorantly made the fatal mistake.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My dear girl! My dear Elfrida! What do you
mean? What fatal mistake do you mean?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I have already indicated it, my dear father. But
I will tell you more distinctly,’ I said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then I told him of the two stations on the road
with similarly sounding names—Kelton, on the English
side, within five miles of the border, and Kilton, on the
Scottish side, just across the border. ‘Intending to be
married at the last-mentioned place, we got out of the
train by misadventure at the first, and we were married
in England.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What disastrous carelessness!’ he groaned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘But, father, we both acted in good faith, and were
married by an ordained clergyman, and had our marriage
duly recorded and witnessed. I do, for myself,
feel that our marriage was lawful and sacred as if we
had been united in the presence of all our relations, by
the combined powers of church and state. Still it is for
you to decide. I have concealed nothing from you, my
dear father. I have now told you all. I leave my fate
and my conduct in your hands. Shall I live on as the
widowed Princess Saviola, or what shall I do?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My dear Elfrida, I must think of it. I must have
time to decide. This is a complication, an embarrassment
for which, dear child, I was not at all prepared.
No, do not look distressed, child. I do not blame you.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Before you came I had made up my mind to leave
Geneva and return to Ireland and take up my abode at
Weirdwaste, where you yourself had fixed my home.
Although I believed then that my husband had repudiated
the ceremony performed at Kelton, deserted
me and married a French heiress, still I had determined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>to stand by my marriage, to call myself by my husband’s
name, and to live in seclusion at Weirdwaste and devote
myself to the education of my son and to the care of the
poor. Such was the plan of life I had laid out for myself
before your arrival, my dear father. Indeed, my
trunks are already packed and my hotel bill paid up
to noon to-morrow. But now I place myself in your
hands most gladly, and I will abide by your judgment.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You could not do better, my dear. One part of
your plan may be carried out at once. We will leave
this place to-morrow morning for England, but not for
Ireland—not for Weirdwaste—rather for a little place
of mine to which you have never been; because, in fact,
it was leased for twenty-one years, and the lease will
only expire on the last day of December.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You mean Myrtle Grove, on the south coast?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes, dear. I have given orders that as soon as it is
vacated it is to be put in complete order. I intended to
live there in strict seclusion. I did not know that I
should have the comfort of my dear daughter’s society.
For the present, that will be better than Weirdwaste for
you, my child.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could not but agree with my father in this view of
the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, as it was growing late, I rang for supper,
which was promptly served in my sitting room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I asked my father if he had engaged apartments for
the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He told me that he had not; that he had set out from
the railway station to find me first, having left all his
luggage in charge of his valet at the station. But he
said that he would attend to the matter immediately
after supper, which he did.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He succeeded in procuring rooms in the same house
and in the same corridor with me. Then he sent a messenger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>from the hotel to the station to fetch his valet
with the luggage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When these arrived he bade me good-night, and retired
to his apartment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He had not seen my beautiful boy, nor had he asked
to see him; nor had I the courage to propose to show
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I felt a little grieved at this neglect of my innocent
child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Early the next morning we left Geneva, and traveling
as fast as steam could carry us by land and sea, in
due time we reached London. We put up at one of the
quietest hotels at the West End. Here my father insisted
that I should pay off my French maid and my
Swiss nurse, and send each back to her own country.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When they were gone, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘And now we take leave of the Princess Saviola forever,
and we know only Lady Elfrida Glennon.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘But my boy, dear father—my boy!’ I pleaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘A proper nurse must be procured for the child
without delay—some healthy young married woman living
in the country, who will take the whole charge of
the boy before we leave London. He is the child of a
deceased son of mine, and so delicate that he must be
reared in the country, and fed on fresh milk and fresh
air.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘And—must I part with my child, oh, father?’ I
pleaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘For a time you must—for his sake as well as for
your own. What should Lady Elfrida Glennon do with
a young child at Myrtle Grove?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would have pleaded with him, but I saw at a glance
that it was useless to do so. Kind, tender, gentle, yielding
as my father was in most cases, yet when he once
made up his mind to any course his will was as strong
as fate. Besides, I and my child were both in his power.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>I had no other alternative than to obey him.
And, finally, notwithstanding the pain I felt in parting
from my boy, I could not fail to see that, under the circumstances,
it was best for the child, and best for us
all, that he should be put out to be nursed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I took the sole charge of the child while we were
seeking for a nurse. We had many applications, but
I was hard to please. At length the right woman came;
a fine, fresh, young creature, with a plump form, bright
eyes, rosy cheeks, a pleasant smile, and a sweet voice.
She attracted me at sight. She was the wife of a young
dairyman. She had one child, a week older than my
boy; and she was well able to nurse twins, if Heaven
had sent twins to her. She was willing and anxious to
take our little orphan. She invited us to go down into
Kent and see for ourselves the comfort and cleanliness
of the dairy farm, and the health and liveliness of her
own child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We took her at her word and went home with her—only
a few miles from London—and we were so well
satisfied with all we found there that we concluded it
would be difficult to do as well, and impossible to do
better, anywhere else; and we left the baby with her,
with a check for twenty-five pounds, that was to be renewed
quarterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I may here say that this young woman, Mary Chester,
did her full duty by her nurseling, as I found in my
periodical visits to the dairy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As soon as Myrtle Grove was ready for occupation,
my father took me down there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a comparatively small place, but a lovely,
secluded home, in a deep, green, wooded glen, about
three miles inland from the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here we lived a very quiet life, seeing no one but
the vicar, the Rev. Mr. Ashe, of St. Agnes’ Church, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>country practitioner, Dr. Ray, and the country lawyer,
Mr. Flood, who was my father’s local man of business.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We were both in deep mourning for my stepmother,
and that fact justified our seclusion from the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Once my brother came down from Eton to spend
the Easter holidays. He had never heard of my runaway
match, and my father decided that he never should
hear of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Once a month my father took me to the dairy farm
in Kent to see his grandchild—the child of his deceased
son,’ as he called my boy, and as the people at the dairy
cottage believed him to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘And it is no falsehood, Elfrida, my dear. The lad
is my grandchild, and is the child of my deceased son—in-law’—he
said. Our deep mourning was supposed by
the dairy people to be worn for this same deceased son
and brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Looking back, I think I had never before spent so
calm, peaceful and contented a time as at Myrtle Grove.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXVII<br> <span class='c005'>THE DAWN OF A BRIGHTER DAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“We liked Myrtle Grove so well that we made it our
home for three years. Its quiet beauty seemed so soothing
and restful after the terrible grandeur of Enderby
Castle and the mournful desolation of Weirdwaste. I
had a little school of poor children, and a small number
of aged and invalid cottagers, whose necessities gave
me interest and occupation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father was now a recluse and a student, passing
most of his time in the small library among his favorite
authors, or, if the weather was very fine, sitting in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>leather chair under one of the trees in the thickly shaded
grounds at the back of the house, with a book in his
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My brother came every Christmas and every midsummer
to spend his vacation with us. As I mentioned
before, he knew nothing of my short, disastrous marriage,
and was to know nothing of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His talk, when he was at home, was full of Angus
Anglesea, his one dear friend. When he was praising
this hypocrite I was forced to make some excuse to get
out of the room, or to keep a painful silence in it, for
I could not contradict him or expose Anglesea’s villainy
to me without betraying facts that it was desirable
should be kept from him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even my father, who knew now every circumstance
attending my imprudent marriage, knew nothing of
Anglesea’s insulting proposal to me. Pride, delicacy
and consideration for that dear father’s feelings prevented
me from telling him. Yet I made him understand
that, under my peculiar circumstances, I did not
want any visitors, especially gentlemen visitors, at Myrtle
Grove—of course always excepting the vicar, the
doctor, the lawyer and my dear brother, who could
scarcely, indeed, be called a visitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In this manner, without having to mention Anglesea’s
name, I kept my brother’s dear friend from coming
to Myrtle Grove.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Before the commencement of every vacation, undaunted
by previous refusals, Glennon would write from
his college, and ask leave to bring his friend home with
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father would then bring the letter to me, and
ask my opinion. I would always tell him—what was
the truth—that my soul shrank from visitors.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he would write something to the same effect in
his reply to Glennon.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“My brother took this very hard, and on his arrival
at home would always complain that it was—in schoolboy
slang—‘a jolly shame’ he could not have Anglesea
to spend the holidays with him as he had always been
accustomed to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He said that he did not know what had come over
‘Friday.’ She had been very fond of Anglesea when
they were at Brighton together. So fond of him that he—Glennon—had
hoped Anglesea might one day be his
brother-in-law, as he was now his brother in heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I said nothing in self-defense at all, but left it to my
father to explain—what he assumed to be the truth—that
I had no especial objection to Anglesea, but that the
state of my health unfitted me to entertain company.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This generally satisfied him, at least for the time
being.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At length, when little more than three years had
passed, my father began to grow weary of our long seclusion
from the world, and proposed that we should
make another tour of the Continent—avoiding as much
as possible the crowded resorts of tourists and betaking
ourselves to quieter scenes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I consented to this, as I did to every plan proposed
by my father. I made but one condition. The Easter
holidays were approaching, and my brother was expected
to come to Myrtle Grove to spend the time with us as
usual. I therefore proposed to my father that Glennon
should now invite his friend to accompany him to Myrtle
Grove, while I myself should go for a week and take
lodgings at the dairyman’s cottage in Kent, where my
child was at nurse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may wonder why I should have done this, knowing
the character of Anglesea as I did. I have sometimes
wondered at the same act. But I think it was from
affection for Glennon I acted. I knew how he longed to
have Anglesea with him at Myrtle Grove. I wished to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>gratify that longing. I knew that nothing I could do
could either cement or sever the bonds of that strong
friendship. I knew also that Anglesea never had and
never would show his cloven foot to Glennon, or that
even if he should do so, Glennon would never tolerate
it; he would fly from it. I felt instinctively that Anglesea
could never harm my brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“More than willingly, gladly, my father agreed to my
plan. He wanted to gratify his son. So I wrote immediately
to see if I could obtain lodgings, ‘for change of
air,’ at the dairy farm. In good time came a favorable
answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then my father wrote to Glennon, authorizing him
to invite his friend to spend the Easter holidays with
him at Myrtle Grove.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not wait for the arrival of the visitor, but on
the Wednesday before Easter I set out alone for Kent,
meaning to engage some country girl in the neighborhood
of the dairy to wait on me while in lodgings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reached the dairy about four o’clock on that
Wednesday afternoon, and found my son, now a fine boy
over three years old, in the rosiest health and most boisterous
spirits. He sprang into his ‘auntie’s’ arms and
covered her with caresses before he began to search her
pockets and her hand bag for the sweetmeats and toys she
was accustomed to bring him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A dainty tea table was waiting for me in a charming
cottage parlor. So Mary Chester coaxed my ‘nephew’
from his ‘auntie’s’ arms and showed me into a clean,
neat, fresh bedroom, snow white, as all delectable bedrooms
were in the days before the ‘decoration’ craze
spread over the land. There I laid off my bonnet and
washed off the railroad dust.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then I returned to the parlor, where my
‘nephew’ was allowed to join me at the tea table, sitting
up in a high armchair.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“That night Mary Chester waited on me as lady’s
maid, but the next day I procured the country girl I had
been thinking of.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I spent a really happy week at the dairy with my
child and his foster-brother. These two children were
so fond of each other that it was a comfort and delight
to me to think of them together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mary Chester had no other children, and she was
entirely devoted to them. John Chester, her husband,
was a fine, wholesome, honest young man, bearing an
excellent character in the neighborhood. We all went
to the parish house together on Easter Sunday, leaving
the two baby boys at home in charge of Mary Chester’s
grandmother, who was too infirm to sit through the long
church service, but who was quite equal to the care of
two children for a few hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As Easter week drew to a close I began to think of
returning to Myrtle Grove.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I did not leave the dairy until I received a letter
from my father, informing me that the visitors had
departed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I loaded my little son, his foster-brother and
his attendants with presents suited to the conditions of
each. I returned heartfelt thanks to Mary Chester for
her excellent care of my ‘nephew,’ and paid her six
months in advance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Finally, on the Thursday after Easter, I bade them
all good-by and set out to return to Myrtle Grove.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I found my father in excellent health, but impatient
to start on our journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hurried my preparations, and two days after we
left England for Germany, where it was my fate first to
meet you, Abel Force, who made all the happiness of
my life.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br> <span class='c005'>NEW LIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“We avoided the ‘highways’ and public resorts of
travel—the grand railway lines, the great cities, the
famous spas, the big hotels, and we sought out the
by-ways—unfrequented hamlets and villages on mountain
heights or in forest depths, as yet undiscovered by the
eyes, unprofaned by the feet of speculators.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We had seen enough of the splendor and magnificence
of Europe; we wished to see some of its real,
working life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, we wished to lose ourselves and find repose in
obscurity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yet where can one go and avoid fate? Or where,
let me ask you, Abel, can we travel and not meet an
American tourist?</p>

<p class='c007'>“You remember the day and the place of our first
meeting. It was on a glorious afternoon in July, when
the sun was sinking in the west and kindling all the
horizon into a conflagration. We were in a little chalet
at the foot of the mountain. We had come out to view
the magnificence of the sunset. The cowherd was penning
his cattle; the shepherd was folding his sheep.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Coming down the mountain path we saw a solitary
tourist, knapsack on back and alpenstock in hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was my first sight of you, Abel; a tall, athletic,
black-bearded man, whom we all first took for a
Tyrolesian.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You came up to the door of the chalet, raised your
hat to us and asked the cottagers if you could have a
night’s lodging.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you remember, Abel? Of course you could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>accommodated—roughly; we were all ‘roughing it’ for
the time being.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So our acquaintance began.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That night you introduced yourself to us by name
and nationality—Abel Force, of Maryland, United
States; and when my father, in return, named himself
and me your face brightened. You told him that on
leaving America you had brought letters of introduction—among
which was one from your late minister to St.
James, addressed to the Earl of Enderby. These letters
were all with your luggage at your hotel at Berne, where
you had left them to come on this pedestrian excursion
to the mountain. You added that you had missed Lord
Enderby in England and learned that he was traveling
on the Continent; that you deemed yourself strangely
fortunate in having thus met him, and would present
your credentials in the form of the ex-minister’s letter,
as soon as we should reach Berne.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The next day we all returned to Berne in company—you,
at my father’s invitation, taking a seat in our
carriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At the Bernerhof Hotel we stopped but one night.
There you found and presented your letter—to prove
that you were no impostor, you said. You joined our
company and traveled where we traveled, and stopped
where we stopped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why should I repeat this to you, you know it already?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only because it is a visible link in the chain of our
destiny.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That long summer, Abel, we spent together! That
long summer, every day of which drew our hearts nearer
and nearer! Even my father, who was ever most reserved
to all but oldest friends and nearest kin, came
to love you like a son.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—feeling then, for the first time, all the bitter significance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>of my own antecedents—resisted the sweet influence
that was flowing into my soul, yet—resisted it
in vain!</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know how silently our love grew, during those
delightful weeks and months we lived and traveled together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knew then, though we might never marry in this
world, even as I know now—though this confession may
part us for this earth—that we are mates for all eternity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There came a day, at last, when we were all in the
ancient city of Grenada, that you went to my father and
asked his consent to win me for your wife. He told you
that he would have a talk with me first, and then give
you an answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father came to me and told me all that had
passed between himself and you, and of your proposal
for my hand, and he asked me how I felt disposed toward
‘Mr. Force.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! the bitter sweet of that moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I told my father I felt so well disposed toward you,
that but for my past calamity and its living evidence I
should accept your hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Abel! my answer did not express the hundredth
part of the love, the joy and the sorrow that strove in
my heart at the time; but I had to control myself and
speak quietly, almost indifferently, in the presence of my
father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He replied by assuring me that he should approve
my marriage with Mr. Force; that as for my calamity,
it was no crime, no fault of mine, but the result of circumstances—that
I was so perfectly and unquestionably
innocent that I might tell the whole story to Mr. Force
without losing a degree of his love and esteem.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At that I became very much alarmed. I declared
to my father that I should die on the spot if ever my
suitor should be told the story of my humiliation; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>under such circumstances I could not look him in the
face and live.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father attempted to argue with me, to call me
morbid, my thoughts and feelings extravagant, exaggerated;
but the violence of my agitation bore him down
and silenced him at last.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What am I to say to Force?’ he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Tell him anything you like—except the story of
my fall—or that I can accept his suit.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You refuse him, then?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I must.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father left me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I kept my room the whole of that day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the next day I went down to the sitting room
we three occupied in common. I certainly did not expect
to find you there, Abel Force; yet there you were,
looking a little graver than usual, but otherwise behaving
as if nothing unusual had been said or done. You
bade me good-morning, handed me a chair, and inquired
after my health.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, though to my surprise I found you in our sitting
room that morning, I certainly expected you to
leave our party on the first opportunity. But you did
not. You remained with us and traveled with us as
before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shrank from speaking to my father on the subject,
yet at length I summoned courage to ask him if he had
given my answer to you. He replied that he had, and
that you had said you could wait and hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We spent the autumn together, as we had spent the
summer; yet, Abel, we were not happy, and as the time
for our return to England and your return to America
approached, and we were to separate to meet no more in
this world, we both grew more and more miserable. As
for me, my heart seemed wasting to death.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“One day in November my father came to me, and
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Elfrida, do you consider me a man of honor, or
not?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘My dear father, what a question!’ was all that I
could answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘But tell me, do you consider me a man of honor?
Yes, or no!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes, my dear father; yes. A man of the most perfect
and most unquestionable honor,’ I replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Good! Then perhaps you will believe me and act
upon my words. Elfrida, Mr. Force has this morning
begged me to speak for him again. Again he offers you
his hand.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Well, my dear father?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Well, Elfrida, he loves you, and you know it. You
love him, and he knows it. You are both dying for each
other, and I know that.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Well, my dear father?’ I said again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Have pity on him and on yourself, and accept his
suit.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘But, my past—my past—which I can never tell
him—never! I could die first.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Elfrida, do you believe your father to be a man of
honor?’ he inquired, for the third time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Dear sir, how can you ask me? I have said, “a
man of indubitable honor,”’ I replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Very well, then. On the truth of a man, on the
honor of a peer, on the faith of a Christian, I swear to
you, Elfrida, that you may marry Force without telling
him one word of your past trouble,’ he said to me, so
solemnly that I could not question him. I could only
receive his words on the high and sacred ground on
which he had spoken them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Abel! was I wrong?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>“‘I am now going to send Force to see you,’ he repeated,
as he left the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two minutes after that you came to me, and before
you left my side I was your promised wife. Oh, Abel!
was I wrong? Was my father misled by his love for
his child? Was I deceived by my love for you? Oh,
Abel! was I wrong? I knew my father’s strict, punctilious
sense of honor. I had seen many instances of it.
He had been a wealthier man had he been a less fastidiously
honorable one. How could I believe that he would
sanction a dishonorable concealment of my story, even
to secure my own happiness?</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could not believe this of my father. And yet I
doubted—I doubted. And this concealment never did
secure my happiness, but has burdened and darkened
and sickened my soul for twenty years.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You remember it was arranged that we should be
married at Myrtle Grove.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We all went to London together. You took apartments
at Langham’s. We went down to Myrtle Grove,
where you were to meet us, a fortnight later, for the
wedding.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what did I do at Myrtle Grove? Prepare for
my wedding?</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! I passed but one day there, and then I hurried
down into Kent and to the dairy farm to see my boy,
whom I had not seen for many months.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I carried loads of toys, pets, sweetmeats, presents
of all sorts—ah! as if gifts could compensate a child for
family recognition, for mother’s love.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I found the boy in high health, happy in his surroundings,
in his foster-parents’ affections, and in his
foster-brother’s companionship. I spent nearly the whole
fortnight preceding my marriage with my child in Kent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two days before the one appointed for the wedding
I took leave of my boy, half heartbroken at the forced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>separation, yet comforted with the knowledge that he at
least was well and happy, and that he would be faithfully
nursed by Mary Chester, and carefully looked after
by my father, who had promised to adopt and educate
him, and to bring him to see me at intervals.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I returned to Myrtle Grove, having made no preparations
for our marriage, which you know was a strictly
private one at the parish church, with only my father to
give me away, and my brother and the parish clerk for
witnesses.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After the wedding, you remember, we took leave of
my dear father, who promised to visit us the ensuing
spring, but who never kept his promise, because he died
suddenly of heart disease during that winter.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXIX<br> <span class='c005'>A CLOUDED HONEYMOON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“We went down to Liverpool and sailed for America,
to commence our new life on your Maryland plantation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, oh, Abel! with a burden of sorrow and remorse
on my heart and conscience which has oppressed and
darkened all my days.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the first winter of our marriage news came to us
of my father’s death, and we mourned him deeply, as
you know. Added to grief for his loss was anxiety for
the fate of the child he had promised to adopt and educate.
No news came to me of my boy. I knew not even
if the quarterly payments had been kept up. When we
went to Baltimore, however, to buy my mourning outfit,
I took the opportunity to send a bill of exchange for a
hundred pounds to Mary Chester on account, and asked
her to send me news of the boy, and to direct her letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>to Bryantown, to which place I intended to go, and I
did go at intervals, in hope to find a letter, but none ever
came.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the spring I received a terrible shock. Report
came that a schooner had been wrecked on the shore, and
that but one life had been saved—the life of a child
who had been washed up on the sands and found there
living.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This child I heard was at the house of Miss Bayard,
who was taking care of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I went—as everybody went—from curiosity to see
the little waif.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There happened to be no visitor at the house when I
entered Miss Bayard’s parlor. She was talkative, as
usual, and told me all about the wreck and rescue as it
is known to you and to all that community. And she
took me into the bedroom adjoining the parlor to look
upon the sleeping boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There he lay upon the clean patchwork quilt, crosswise
upon the bed, his flaxen head upon the snowy pillow,
a gray woolen shawl spread over him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I approached and stooped to look at his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heaven of heavens!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think—think what I must have felt on recognizing
my own child!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surprise, delight, wonder, terror—all shook me in
turns as I gazed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Eh, ma’am! I don’t wonder it gives you a turn! It
did me, I tell you!’ the good woman whispered, as she
stood beside me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a tumult of emotion I withdrew from the room. I
was afraid the child might open his eyes and see me,
and I knew as surely as I had recognized him would the
little one remember me, and call me by my name as soon
as he should set eyes upon me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was afraid to stay any longer, or to ask any more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>questions, lest I should in some manner betray myself.
I took leave of Miss Bayard, and left the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The rescued child was the talk of the county for the
whole season. Every one wondered and speculated as
to the boy’s birth and social position, but no one could
decide upon it, for there was no mark on the nightdress
in which the little one had been found.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a few days I heard that you, my beloved and honored
husband—you, of all men—had taken upon yourself
the cost of the child’s maintenance and education;
that you had engaged to pay Miss Bayard a liberal
quarterly allowance for her care of the boy, and to send
him to school, as soon as he should be old enough to go.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, when I heard this, my better angel urged me
to confide in you—to confess the truth and throw myself
upon your mercy—the mercy of the truest, noblest, tenderest
heart that ever beat!</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I dared not do it. The longer I had kept my
secret from you the harder it was to tell. I feared that
you would ask me why I had not told you this before
our marriage. I feared that you might even part with
me. And the longer I had lived with you, the more I
loved you, the harder was the thought of parting from
you. I could not risk the loss, even though to retain
your love seemed almost a theft.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not tell you, nor did I show any sympathy in
your care of the friendless child. I did not go near my
boy, lest he should recognize and innocently betray me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So weeks passed into months, and months passed into
years. Children came to us, and drew our hearts even
more closely together, if that were possible, than they
had been before; but though I loved our little girls as
fondly as ever <a id='t228'></a>a mother did, yet I loved them no more
than I loved the dear boy whom I dared not acknowledge,
or even look upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was not until Roland was at school, and time and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>change of fashion in clothing and hair-dressing had
made such alteration in my appearance that I judged it
safe to do so, I first saw my son face to face, and shook
hands with him. How he stared at me! his mind evidently
startled and perplexed by the phantom of a remembrance
he could not fix or define.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After that I saw him often, and was able to befriend
him; but I was often troubled by the look of perplexity
in the boy’s eyes when they met mine. After a while,
however, this shade of memory faded quite away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Years passed, and the old sorrow also seemed to have
gone like some morning cloud of spring, leaving scarcely
a trace behind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was on that visit to Niagara Falls, now nearly
seven years ago, when I met in the parlor of the hotel
the one man I dreaded more than all men or all devils—Angus
Anglesea!</p>

<p class='c007'>“I saw my danger as soon as our eyes met. I knew
that for the old repulse I had given him at Geneva he
would now take his revenge. Yet I tried to look him
down, but I could not. You were by my side. I was
obliged to present him to you. You had heard of Angus
Anglesea from my father and from my brother, and had
heard nothing but praise of the man from them. You
gave him a warm welcome. You pressed him to come
down and visit us at Mondreer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Afterward, to you alone I protested against this visit
with as much energy as I dared to use; for I could not
explain to you why he ought not be our guest. But you
thought me somewhat capricious, and declared that you
could not withdraw an invitation once given.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I appealed to him, to any little remnant of
pride, honor or delicacy that might remain somewhere
in his depraved nature, not to accept your invitation—not
to enter a house which his presence would desecrate.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“He laughed in my face! He told me that he had
already accepted the invitation, and that he meant to
make the visit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know what followed. He came down with us
to Mondreer. He cast his eyes upon our dear daughter,
Odalite, and on her fortune—not only on her American
fortune, but on her English prospects.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! my poor Odalite! She was engaged to be married
to her faithful lover, Leonidas Force, who was
expected home on the Christmas of that year; and she
was as true as truth to her love; she was not for a
moment ‘fascinated by the admiration of the brilliant
stranger,’ as people said. She sacrificed herself to save
me; and in saving me, to save you and her sisters.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know what that snake who had entered our
paradise threatened to do if he were not bought off by
the hand and fortune and prospects of our daughter
Odalite? He threatened to publish my secret to the
whole world!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! how I mourned then that I had not told you the
sad story before accepting your offer of marriage, and
left you free to withdraw or to renew that offer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was too late then! Every year that I had kept
the story from you made it harder and more humiliating
to tell. And he threatened to tell—not you—that would
have been terrible enough—but to tell everybody!—to
tell the story in the barrooms of the country inns, at the
gentlemen’s wine parties and oyster suppers—and everywhere!
He would leave our house, take up his lodgings
at the Calvert, and spread the venom over the whole
community. That would have been fatal! Abel, this
story, as he would have told it, must have driven us all
in dishonor from the neighborhood. I think it would
have killed you. You are strong and brave, and could
have borne much—everything but dishonor! That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>would have killed you! I know it would have driven
me mad, and it would have blighted the lives of our
children.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was nearly insane, even then. Some women in
such a position would have committed suicide; but,
apart from its sinfulness, it would have been ineffectual
in my case, as, if I had died, he would still have blackmailed
Odalite. Some other women in my position
would have killed Anglesea. I knew that; and I knew
that if ever man deserved death at a woman’s hands,
he did at mine; but I was not even tempted so ruthlessly
to break the sacred laws of God. Nay, let me say
here, that weak, blind and foolish as I have been, I have
not only tried to keep, but I have kept those laws from
my youth up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it, then, that I have confessed to you? Not
a sin, not a fault, but a secret that I have kept from you
because I had not strength enough to tell you, or light
enough to know you, or wisdom enough to confide in
your wisdom. It was no sin of mine that my marriage
was a deception practiced upon me; but it was a great
wrong to you to keep the secret of that marriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know now the secret of my life—why I consented
to sacrifice Odalite to that man, from whom she
was saved as by a miracle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it a mockery to ask you to pardon this lifelong
secret, Abel? I know that you will pardon as freely
as God pardons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But when you have seen these lines you may never
afterward see me. Heaven knows.</p>

<hr class='c013'>

<p class='c007'>“I have written the foregoing confession to put it
away, lest death take me unaware, leaving me no time
to tell the true story as I only can tell it.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Abel Force had finished reading this manuscript
he sat with it in his hand, thoughtfully gazing at
the paper and almost involuntarily listening for any
sound from the adjoining bedroom, where his wife lay
in a very precarious condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last he folded up the parcel and put it into his
breast pocket, muttering to himself that he must keep
it out of sight until he could get an opportunity to
burn it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he softly left the room and went and tapped
gently at the door of his wife’s chamber.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nurse opened the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is Mrs. Force?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is sleeping under the influence of an opiate.
The doctor thinks that if she sleeps well through the
night she will be very much better to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>The nurse softly closed the door, and Mr. Force returned
to the little room, where he lighted the gas, for
it was growing dark, made some little improvement in
his toilet, for it was dinner time, and then hurried
downstairs, for he had eaten nothing since breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>He opened the parlor door, and was surprised to find
a group of many people gathered around his own party.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wynnette sprang out from them all to meet him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! papa, I have not seen you since early this morning.
Where have you been? We had all begun to fear
that you were a ‘mysterious disappearance’!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear, I have been closely engaged all day. Who
are those with you?” inquired Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who? Who but your old friends and neighbors,
Mrs. Dorothy Hedge, Miss Susannah Grandiere and Mr.
Samuel Grandiere. Come! Come and speak to them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They here! Why, how did they find us out?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Joshua found them and brought them here, else they
never would have found us out. And yet people say that
dogs have no souls!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force hurried to meet the friends from St.
Mary’s, and warmly shook hands with them all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are so sorry to hear that Mrs. Force is indisposed,”
said Mrs. Hedge, when these greetings were
over.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has had a severe nervous shock. Such strokes
must be epidemic among those who live amid ‘war’s
alarms,’ you know, Mrs. Hedge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, of course. But all war’s alarms are not disastrous.
What a glorious deed young Leonidas Force has
done! I congratulate you on your nephew, Mr. Force.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, madam. Will you take my arm down
to dinner? There is the gong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole party arose and went down into the dining
room and took their places at the table; the party
filled up a large one.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>After dinner they returned to the drawing room for a
little while, and then the visitors from St. Mary’s bade
good-night, and—accompanied by Capt. Grandiere and
Rosemary Hedge—went away to take possession of their
rooms at a boarding house that had been found for them
in E Street.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force and Lord Enderby lighted a couple of
cigars and walked out on the bright and busy avenue to
smoke and stroll. Between the gas lamps and the illuminated
shop windows the scene was almost as light as
day, and, with its crowd of pedestrians, as noisy as a
fair.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up and down they strolled and smoked until, tired
of being jolted, or, as the earl put it, “walked over,”
they turned up the west side of Fifteenth Street, where
the sidewalk was brilliantly lighted, yet almost vacant of
passengers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here they walked and talked in the cool of the evening,
unconscious of a dark figure approaching them
from the north end of the street, whose advent was to
have the most important effect on the destinies of several
of our friends. They were going to meet the form that
was approaching them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both looked up carelessly and saw a tall, soldiery
looking man, who, coming up, held out his hand with
an exclamation of surprise and pleasure:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Enderby!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl stared for a second and then seized the
offered hand, crying with delight:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anglesea!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When did you arrive?”</p>

<p class='c007'>This question was put, in the same words, at the same
time by both.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But three days since,” answered Lord Enderby.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only this afternoon,” replied Gen. Anglesea. “I
have come to America to see your sister.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“Let me present you to my brother-in-law—Mr.
Force, of Mondreer, Maryland. Mr. Force—Gen. Anglesea,
late of the East Indian service—the real Simon
Pure, you understand, Abel!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The two gentlemen, thus introduced, bowed deeply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You say you have come over to see my sister?” inquired
the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes! On very important business! You may judge
how important when I tell you that it has brought me
across the ocean at such a time as this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My sister is at this time indisposed. I think it will
be a day or two before she is capable of attending to any
business. But here is her husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course. I am very happy to meet Mr. Force, and
shall be ready, at his convenience, to enter upon this
business. It concerns Lady Elfrida’s first marriage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, if Mr. Force had not already learned the truth
concerning that first marriage, I know not what might
have been the consequences of this sudden announcement.
As it was, Lady Elfrida’s second husband, with
great presence of mind, replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Precisely. I shall be ready to attend to you as soon
as you please.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As for Lord Enderby—who had never heard a word
about his sister’s first marriage—he was considerably
startled, but, with equal presence of mind, recovered
himself, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it is necessary that this matter should be entered
upon this evening, we had better withdraw into apartments.
We can scarcely discuss important business in
the street.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are quite right. And I am at your service,”
assented the general.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But where shall we go? Privacy is hardly to be had
at any price in this overcrowded city. We have not a
private sitting room at our hotel.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“Come with me, then,” said Anglesea. “I have, by a
fortunate chance, been able to secure a comfortable bedroom,
with a little box of a sitting room adjoining.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A box of a sitting room! What a boon! What a
blessing in these times!” said the earl, as he turned with
the squire and the general to walk to the last-mentioned
gentleman’s hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ten minutes later they were all three seated around
a small table, on which stood a bottle of sherry, some
wineglasses, and cigars.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My business with Lady Elfrida,” began Anglesea,
“is to restore to her some documents that have been too
long, indeed, in my possession, though I did not really
anticipate they would ever be called for, as they now
appear to be, to confirm her son’s claim to the estate
of his uncle—Antonio Saviola.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Her son?’” thought the earl to himself; but he
said nothing; he only looked at Abel Force, whose face
was quite impenetrable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope the young gentleman is living and is quite
well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, thank you, my stepson is quite well, and a very
fine young man altogether.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl looked from one to the other. Here was a
revelation! His sister had been twice married, and she
had a living son by her first marriage! And Abel Force
knew this! And he himself had never even suspected
such a thing! Why had not he—her brother—her only
living relative besides her husband and children—been
told of this first marriage? Did his father know it, and
conspire to keep the secret from him, too? Did Anglesea
also know it from the first, and confederate with all
the other conspirators to keep the secret from him—the
son, the brother, the bosom friend? It was very hard
on him, the injured earl reflected.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime the general had taken out from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>rolled morocco case a few parchments, which he spread
upon the little table—pushing all the glasses together
to make room. Then, missing some papers from among
the others, he arose and went into the adjoining chamber
to look for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Enderby seized the opportunity afforded by his
temporary absence to stoop and whisper to the squire:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This sudden news of my sister’s first marriage has
fallen like a thunderbolt upon me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Has it?” inquired the squire, with forced calmness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should think so! I had never dreamed of such a
thing! Why was it kept a secret from me? Did my
father know it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father knew it! Anglesea knew it! You knew
it! Why was it kept secret from me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear Enderby—because it seemed to your father
necessary that it should be kept so,” soothingly replied
the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was the marriage a discreditable one, then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, it was not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then why, in the name of Heaven, could it not have
been announced?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear Enderby—secrecy is not always wrong and
foolish; it is sometimes wise and right. It was so in
this instance. And I may further promise to satisfy you
of this in a few hours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When you married my sister, did you know that she
had been married before, and that she had a living son
by that first marriage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Most certainly I did!” said Mr. Force, with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And yet I remember—I swear that I remember—she
signed her name to her marriage register with you,
Elfrida Glennon.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“Hush! here comes Anglesea,” said the squire, as the
general entered the room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLI<br> <span class='c005'>THE OTHER SIDE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“You are, of course, aware,” said the latter, sitting
down at the table and beginning to arrange his papers
before him—“you are, of course, aware of my own intimate
connection with the very youthful marriage of my
friends, Lady Elfrida Glennon and Prince Luigi Saviola?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force, thoroughly informed of that circumstance,
could bow acquiescence. This assent was supposed to
answer also for Lord Enderby—who, however, knew
nothing about it—and the general continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know that at that time I was a very young man,
scarcely having attained my majority. I had a warm
friendship for, and a youthful sympathy with, the young
lovers; yet I would have dissuaded Saviola from the
hasty marriage if I could have done so. But who can
turn an Italian lover from his love chase? Seeing that
I could do nothing to prevent the marriage that was sure
to come off, sooner or later—for her father was in the
East, and her brother was at Eton, and a minor, and she
herself only in the care of two teachers for whom she
had neither love nor esteem—I determined to do a
brother’s or a father’s part by her, at least so far as
going with the mad pair and seeing that the marriage
ceremony was duly and lawfully performed in Scotland.
But you have heard all this before, and I am wasting
time, perhaps, in trying to excuse myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your course in that affair needs no excuse, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>rather the gratitude of all who are interested in Lady
Elfrida,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thank you, sir. I did indeed act in the interest of
the young lady. I went to Scotland with the young pair
and saw them properly married, in the parlor of the
manse, by the minister, at Kilton, Dumfries, North
Briton; and in addition to the certificate given to the
bride, I took a duplicate, duly signed and witnessed,
because I thought it just possible the young lady might
mislay or lose her lines.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are sure that the place at which you stopped for
the marriage was Kilton, in Scotland, and not Kelton, a
few miles south in England?” inquired Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anglesea lifted his eyes from the paper in his hand
and looked at the questioner with surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are so near together on the same line, and the
sound of the names are so similar, that the mistake
might easily have been made—on a night journey,” Mr.
Force explained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It might, but it was not. Here is the certificate.
Will you examine it?” said the general, laying the document
before the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sure enough, there was the printed heading:</p>

<p class='c007'>Parish of Kilton, Dumfries, N. B.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then followed the date and the record of the marriage
between Luigi Saviola, of Naples, Italy, and Elfrida
Glennon, of Northumberland, England, signed
by the minister and attested by two witnesses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abel Force heaved so deep a sigh of relief that Lord
Enderby bent toward him and inquired:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the matter? Why were you so anxious
about this point?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will tell you later. I will explain everything later.
For the present let us listen to the facts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish to put one question to you, Anglesea, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>the name of our lifelong friendship: Why did you never
inform me of my sister’s marriage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because, my dear fellow, I was in honor bound to
keep the secret until the parties concerned announced
their marriage. As I heard nothing about it from you
or your father, I was restrained from mentioning the
subject.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see! I see!” assented the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should not have brought up the matter now had
not the death of Saviola and the marriage of his widow
absolved me from my implied pledge of secrecy; and
very important considerations constrained me to cross
the ocean to seek out Lady Elfrida and to speak of her
first marriage, of which I was the principal witness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thank you, both on the part of Lady Elfrida and
myself, for the great interest you have felt and the great
trouble you have taken in her cause,” said Abel Force
so earnestly that Lord Enderby muttered to himself:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder what in the deuce has come over the squire?
But I shall know presently, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must explain these considerations,” continued the
general. “I was at Naples last year, where I renewed
my acquaintance with the aged prince, Antonio Saviola,
whom I had known years before. We met at the house
of a mutual friend. He invited me to dine <em>tête-à-tête</em>
with him on the next day, and to come early, as he
wished to converse with me on a subject near. I accepted
the invitation and went.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pardon,” said the earl; “what relation was Prince
Antonio to Luigi Saviola?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was the granduncle of Luigi, who was his next
of kin. When I reached the Palazzo Saviola I was at
once ushered into the presence of the prince, who received
me in his library with much cordiality. He entered
at once upon the subject in his mind by saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You were the attendant of my grandnephew, Luigi,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>on the occasion of his marriage with the only daughter
of an English earl?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes, sir,’ I answered, a little surprised that he
should know the fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘So I was informed by a letter from my nephew
soon after the occurrence. You were also his second in
the fatal duel in Paris, about a year later, in which my
nephew lost his life?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No, prince. I was not in Paris at the time of that
unhappy meeting,’ I answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Then I have been misinformed upon that point.
But there is no question of your having been a witness
to his marriage?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘No question at all, prince. I was present in the
interests of the lady, taking the place of her father or
brother, one of whom should have been there to give her
away.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Precisely. That is how I understood from Luigi
your presence at this Montague and Capulet marriage.
I have lost sight of the widow entirely. I last heard of
her at Geneva. In a letter written to me by my unhappy
nephew on the night before his duel he told me
that his wife was at the Beau Rivage, Geneva, expecting
the birth of a child; that if he should survive the meeting
of the next day he would hurry to her side. If he
should fall, he recommended her to my sympathy and
compassion. This letter found me prostrate with
typhoid fever, and did not meet my eyes for weeks after
it was written. My nephew was dead and buried. His
widow had left Geneva, accompanied by her father and
her infant. All my efforts to find them proved fruitless,
and at last I gave up inquiry. Only lately have I become
again interested in the subject. The reason is this:
I am very aged, near ninety. My sons and grandsons
have all gone before me to the better land. The last,
Vittorio, departed some months since. I have no heirs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>unless it happens that the posthumous child of Luigi
proves to be a son and is now living. It is to ascertain
this point that I have called you here to-day.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could tell him nothing about the child, of whom
I had never heard. But I offered to go to Geneva in
person, and search the church register of the year and
month in which the child of Luigi and Elfrida was
born, and ascertain whether that child were son or
daughter. I did so, and succeeded in procuring an attested
copy of the registry of birth and baptism of Rolando,
son of Luigi Antonio Saviola and Elfrida, his
wife. This I took to Naples and laid before the old
prince, together with the certificate of the marriage of
Luigi and Elfrida. The old man was very near his
end, but he lived long enough to acknowledge the boy as
his legal heir, and to make a will, leaving him all his
devisable property. ‘For I feel sure the youth is living,
<em>Amigo</em>,’ he said. ‘Fortune would not be so cruel as
to cut off the entire family of Saviola.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Those were his last words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After the funeral, I prepared to return to England,
to search for Lady Elfrida and her son. Judge of my
surprise when I learned, by a mere accident, that she
had been with her family at Naples only a few weeks
before. I went over to England, only to hear that she
had sailed, with all her party, for America. I took ship
and followed. Looked for you in New York in vain.
Remembered that you had a country seat at Mondreer,
Maryland. Came down to Washington to-day en route
for Mondreer. Ran up against you, Enderby, in the
street to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A lucky meeting,” said the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. These documents before me are attested copies—the
first of the certificates of the marriage between
Luigi Saviola and Elfrida Glennon; the second of the
registry of baptism of Rolando, their son; the third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>of the last will and testament of Antonio Saviola. These
will establish the claim of the young man, who, you say,
is alive and well, to the estate of his late uncle. When
may I bring them to Lady Elfrida?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To-morrow, if you please,” replied Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the earl and the squire arose, and, with renewed
thanks, bade the general good-night.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLII<br> <span class='c005'>THE EARL’S DISCOVERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The church bells were chiming twelve, midnight, as
the earl and the squire walked along the now almost
deserted avenue toward their hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had no idea it was so late,” said the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor I,” assented the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Force!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you tell me now, as we walk along, why my
sister’s first marriage was kept a secret from me during
all these years? Why even my chum in college, my
fellow soldier in camp, never once mentioned the matter
to me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has explained that in his case it was because no
one spoke of it to him, and it was not his cue to be the
first to allude to it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why? Why was all this mystery about a marriage
that was honorable enough in itself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because there was a fatal misapprehension. I call
it fatal, on account of the years of untold misery it entailed
upon more than one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Explain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You remember, and can now at last appreciate, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>dreary loneliness and isolation of your sister’s childhood
and early youth at Weirdwaste?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes! yes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the bewildering change that Brighton and a
princely lover must have been to the hitherto solitary
recluse of Weirdwaste?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fear of having to return to that desolation must
have been as strong a motive as love itself in inducing
her to fly to Scotland with her lover.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Most probably.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She had neither father, nor brother, nor any relative
near her; no one but governesses and servants.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! my poor father never meant to be unkind, but
it was cruel to leave her in that isolation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She found it so; and she listened to the pleadings of
her lover, whom her imagination had elevated into a
hero, martyr, patriot and humanitarian, when, in fact,
he was only a political refugee, on account of some hotheaded
revolutionary utterances he had given.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I heard of Saviola’s exile while at Brighton;
but I never met the man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think your friend Anglesea had not met him at the
time you were in Brighton. He first met Saviola at
Lord Middlemoor’s, on Brunswick Terrace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You seem to be well informed on all points of this
affair, Force.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pretty well,” said the squire; “but to proceed. Your
sister went to Scotland to marry Saviola, escorted by
your friend Anglesea, who, having done all he could to
dissuade the Italian from running away with the young
lady, and having failed, was resolved that the marriage
that he could not prevent should at least be properly and
legally solemnized.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, he told us that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he told you also that he was bound to secrecy.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“He did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, now to the point. When the newly married
pair parted from Anglesea, on the day of their marriage,
they never saw him again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. You heard Anglesea relate how the old Prince
Antonio Saviola supposed him—Anglesea—to have
acted as second to Luigi Saviola on the occasion of his
fatal duel with the Duc de Montmeri, and how he—Anglesea—had
denied all knowledge of the tragedy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I did hear, and I remembered that Anglesea
was at that very time at college with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, then, Enderby, listen: If the bona-fide Anglesea
did not officiate as Luigi Saviola’s second in that
duel, his double, Byrne Stukely, did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Anglesea’s <em>bête noir</em>, evil genius, material counterpart,
Byrne Stukely, did. He personated Anglesea
in Paris, on the dueling ground, and at the death of
Saviola, and in the apartments of Saviola’s widow!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! what new infamy is this of which you tell me?
I shall have to prosecute that villain if he should escape
the law here!” exclaimed the earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He will not escape the law here; but to proceed——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes—yes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stukely received the last dying messages from the
lips of Saviola, and some little time afterward took them
to his widow in Geneva. There, passing himself off for
Anglesea—undetected, unsuspected by her, he delivered
his credentials, and won her confidence. But, when he
saw the beautiful young widow, he dared to think of
her in a manner that should have brought down upon
him severe chastisement.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How? What?” demanded the earl, in an excited
voice.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“Calm yourself, Enderby. Be patient, my friend.
Here is our hotel. Shall we go in?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! no! I cannot go indoors now! Let us walk
here where the night air cools my head—unless you are
tired, Force?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I am not tired. We will walk on a little way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, go on!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With an artful delicacy, with sham sympathy, he
approached the subject, and told Saviola’s widow that
she was, in fact, no widow at all; that her marriage with
the late prince was null and void from the first, because
it had been celebrated at Kelton, in Cumberland, England,
instead of at Kilton, in ——shire, Scotland. He
manufactured plenty of false evidence to prove his falsehood
to be truth, and then—and then——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What? what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He insulted the lady with the offer of his heart
and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Protection!” murmured the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl sprang into the air as if he had been shot,
but came down upon his feet. He said nothing. There
are some things that will not bear a single word of comment.
This was one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She ordered the venomous reptile from her presence,
and he crawled away, but left his poisoned sting behind.
The consummate art of his false evidence had convinced
her, as it afterward convinced her father, and, later on,
myself also, that her marriage ceremony with Saviola
was an empty form—null and void. Her father never
knew otherwise. She does not know otherwise to this
day. And I knew no better until to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You believed my sister, your wife, to have been the
victim of a false first marriage until to-night?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, until the moment when Gen. Anglesea produced
the certificate, and told the true story.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>“And yet you married her!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, thank Heaven, I was permitted to marry her,
and she has been the light of my life,” said the squire,
fervently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With this cloud overshadowing her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Enderby, every one of us has something to bear.
This secret and its evil consequences have been our cross.
We have had no other. We have loved each other truly,
and we have been happy in our married life, notwithstanding
our cross.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Force, you are a noble fellow! But now about her
son. Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said the squire, smiling and hesitating, “he
is a very fine young man, a prisoner of war at present,
but he shall be free to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not—Roland Bayard!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Roland Bayard. As fine a young man as
breathes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, after his mother, he is my heir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Anglesea has proved his legal right to be called
so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Force, does the boy know of his parentage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. His birth was a mystery to him, as it was to
every one except me and his mother. He believes himself
to be the son of Byrne Stukely, and that is the reason
why his tongue has been tied, so that he will not
give the evidence that will clear himself and go near to
hang Stukely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see! I see!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he shall give it to-morrow, and be set at liberty.
I shall see to that. Here we are again at the door of our
hotel. Shall we go in? Or have you anything else to
ask me?” questioned the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; nothing else to-night. Let us go in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The two gentlemen entered the house, got their chamber
keys from the sleepy watchman, and went upstairs.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>The public parlors were dark and deserted. The gas
burned low in the halls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl and the squire bade each other good-night
and separated, and went off to their several apartments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force climbed another flight of stairs to seek the
little room he had occupied since his wife’s illness.</p>

<p class='c007'>He paused at the door of her sick chamber and
knocked lightly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night nurse answered the summons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is Mrs. Force this evening?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is better, sir, and she is sleeping nicely,” replied
the woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven! Good-night,” said the squire, as he
turned away and entered his own little room.</p>

<p class='c007'>He retired to bed, too happy to sleep until near morning,
when at length he sank to rest.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLIII<br> <span class='c005'>HUSBAND AND WIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was late in the morning when Abel Force was
awakened by a gentle tapping at his chamber door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is there?” he inquired, as he hastily arose,
thrust his feet into slippers, drew on his dressing gown,
and opened the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is I, papa,” said Wynnette, in a cheerful voice,
and with a bright smile, that at once dispelled the
squire’s fears for his wife, which had been aroused by
the summons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is your mother?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is better, papa. She is awake now. Dr. Bolton
says that we may see her, but only one at a time. I
thought you would like to be the first, so I came to call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>you. I did not know that you were still asleep. It is
late, you see.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it is late; but I was up nearly all night. Thank
Heaven that your mother is better. Come in, Wynnette.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hadn’t I better leave you to dress, papa?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Presently. But I wish to send a line by you to your
mother before I go to her. I will dress while you take
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wynnette entered the room, closed the door, and sat
down on the side of the little bed to wait for the “line.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force went to the small stand, and wrote:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dearest dear, I have read your paper, and I love you
as ever—more than ever, if that were possible; for love
is deepened and sanctified by sympathy with all that you
have suffered. Send me word by our Wynnette if you
feel well enough to see me. I am longing to be with
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He folded the paper and gave it to his daughter, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go in to see your mother, and when you have kissed
and embraced her give her this note, and wait until she
reads it. Then bring me any message that she may
send.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wynnette took the missive, wondering a little why her
father should send it, and left the room to deliver it.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Mr. Force had acted with prudent foresight. He
feared that, in his wife’s nervous and enfeebled condition,
the sudden sight of him in her room while she was
yet in doubt about his feelings toward her, might have
a disastrous effect upon her health. Therefore he had
sent the short, loving message as a preparation for his
visit.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>He dressed himself in a great hurry, and waited for
the return of Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c007'>She came while he was drawing on his coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma wants you to come at once and see her alone.
She has sent out the nurse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you find her, Wynnette?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, she is better. All right, I should think, except
that she is very weak and as white as chalk. She cried
when she read your note, papa. Why did she cry, papa?
What was in your note?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She cried from nervousness, my dear. There was
nothing in my note to distress her. I expressed the sympathy
I felt, and asked her if she was able to see me,”
replied the squire, truthfully, as far as the words went,
yet evasively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh!” said Wynnette, and she was perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going to see her now,” said the squire, as he
passed out of his own little room and went to his wife’s
chamber.</p>

<p class='c007'>He opened the door and passed in. The window shutters
were open, but the white shades were down and the
lace curtains drawn, so that the chamber was filled with
a soft, dim, white light, that showed the low French bed
and the fair form upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Mr. Force approached his wife, she put up her
hands and covered her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Elfrida,” he said, in low and tender tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, how can I look you in the face?” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can I kiss you, dear, unless you take away your
hands?” he said, gently removing them and pressing his
lips to hers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Abel! if I could leave my bed—I should be at
your feet! It is on my knees that I should receive your
forgiveness,” she moaned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dearest,” he whispered, kissing her again—“my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>dearest, I do not offer you forgiveness, for you have
done me no wrong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes! oh, yes! I had a shameful secret, and I kept
it from you, and married you! My love——No, no!
my selfish feeling was not worthy of the name of love,
yet what else can I call it? Whatever it was, it blinded
me to honor and duty and drew me on to marry you,
with that shameful secret in my heart,” she moaned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear wife, you are very morbid. Your secret was
not a shameful one, and it was never kept from me,” he
answered, caressingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, Abel! What are you telling me?” she inquired,
starting up in bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lie down again. Calm yourself and keep very quiet,
Elfrida. I have much to tell you, and I will tell you
all. Confession for confession, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The idea that you should have anything to confess!
It is impossible, Abel!” she said, as she sank back on her
pillow and lay quietly as he had told her to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Elfrida! Confession for confession! for I knew
your secret when we married, but I never let you suspect
that I knew it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?” she breathed, in wonder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your father told me, when I asked him for your
hand. The late earl had insight enough into character
to see that he could trust me; that I could never blame
you for the deception he believed had been practiced
upon you; that I should consider you as truly an honorable
widow as if the marriage you believed to have been
a fraud, had been as legal a bond as it is now proved to
have been!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What—what are you saying, Abel? I—I—cannot
comprehend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am telling you that Saviola married you in good
faith, and that your marriage was as lawful as heaven
and earth could make it! But lie still, keep quiet, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>let me tell my story in my own way. You will then be
able to comprehend it better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will try,” she said, settling herself once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will remember that when I asked your father
for your hand he said that he must have a talk with you
before he could give an answer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, he told me so, when he came to talk with me of
your proposal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You remember that you refused me, all on account
of that secret, which you would not reveal. I, not knowing
why you refused me, but certainly knowing that you
returned my love, declined to take no for an answer, and
so I continued to be a member of your father’s traveling
party.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“After some weeks I again renewed my proposal for
your hand to the earl, your father, begging his intercession
with you on my behalf. It was then that he took
me into his confidence and told me of the false marriage
into which—he believed—you had been led while yet a
young, motherless girl in the schoolroom, and of the
child that had been born of that marriage, and finally
of the death of the man who had perpetrated the supposed
wrong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must have been a great shock to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A shock that was without the least blame to you, my
darling wife; so that when I recovered from it I told
your father that you were in my eyes a blameless widow,
and that I should be the proudest and happiest man alive
if I could be blessed with your love and honored with
your hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Abel! Generous soul!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He then told me where the difficulty lay—that you
imagined yourself so—so—well, so injured by the wrong
which had been done you—or which you believed had
been done you—that you could never bring yourself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>either to reveal it to me, or to marry me without having
revealed it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I could not—I could have died, or lived in misery
sooner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So your father told me. But I was a young man,
in love, my dearest, and therefore ready with expedients.
I said to the earl:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I see a way out of all this.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“He replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Tell me, for I see none.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You have told me these antecedents, and your most
fastidious sense of honor is satisfied. I know the secret,
and still pray for the honor of your daughter’s hand, as
I believe I have already the blessing of her love. Pray
go, therefore, to your daughter, ask her if she considers
you a man of honor and integrity worthy of her trust.
Of course, she will earnestly, and with wonder and indignation
at such a question, assure you that she does.
You will then please tell her of my renewed proposals
and assure her, in turn, that on your honor as a peer,
and your faith as a Christian, she may accept my hand
without revealing her secret, and without detriment to
her conscience.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The earl remained plunged in thought for a few minutes,
and then replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I believe you have found a way out of the labyrinth.
I will do as you request upon one condition.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I asked him what it was. He answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘That you never tell my daughter that you knew her
secret. She is so morbid on that point, I believe she
would die if she thought you knew it.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I promised. And, Elfrida, darling, you know the
rest. We married, each having a secret from the other—yours
the secret of your first marriage, mine the secret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>of the forbidden knowledge of that marriage. Did I
not say that I should offer confession for confession?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLIV<br> <span class='c005'>LOVE STRONGER THAN FATE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Abel! what did you think of me all that time?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought that you were the loveliest, yet the most
morbid, woman, upon one point, on the face of the
earth. Often when I looked at you and saw you preoccupied
and very sorrowful, I wished that you would
be brave enough to tell me your trouble and so relieve
your heart and find rest in my sympathy. But you
never took courage to speak of it, and I was bound by
my promise to the late earl never to reveal my knowledge
unless you should first trust me with your secret.
You have done so at last, and enabled me to make my
confession also.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And oh! Abel, you educated my son!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our son. I adopted him when I married his
mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Abel! Noble heart!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush, dear, I am but an honest and well-meaning
man. At least I hope I am that much. As soon as we
heard of the earl’s death I sent for the child, whom he
had cared for while he lived. The boy was brought
over in a Baltimore clipper and I went to the city to
meet him. I found the boy thriving, and I sent him
down to Port Tobacco by sea while I came home by land.
I intended that he should be reared in Port Tobacco,
where I could go to see him often and watch over his
training. It was a stormy season, and I, traveling by the
shorter land route, reached home fully a week before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>the tempest-tossed and battered <em>Carrier Pigeon</em> was
driven upon our shores and wrecked with the loss of all
on board, except the child alone, who was strangely
saved. I should have taken him at once to our own
home but for consideration of you. I gave him in charge
of Miss Bayard. In a day or two I knew that you had
seen and recognized the boy. Then I noticed that any
mention of the wrecked child distressed you. So I did
all that I could for the little lad without forcing him
upon your notice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My noble Abel! I have never deserved such a
heart!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No more of that, love. I think now that I have
made ‘a clean breast of it.’ I think I have told you all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Except this: You said that my first marriage was
not a fraud, but a legal act. Oh! is that true? And
if true, how came you to know it?” inquired the lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, I must explain that. And then, Elfrida,
you must neither talk nor listen longer. You are exhausted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But tell me, first, how do you know my first marriage
was legal?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you remember the discovery we made the day before
you were taken ill?—the discovery that the villain
who attempted to blackmail you and marry our heiress,
under the name of Angus Anglesea, was not that gallant
officer at all, but an impostor, taking advantage of the
closest possible resemblance to Anglesea to carry out his
own nefarious purposes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; a relative of Anglesea—Byrne Stukely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The same. Well, twenty years ago Anglesea and
Stukely—I hate to connect their names—were exact
counterparts, as you have heard. Well, this same
Stukely was in Paris at the time that Saviola was there,
and was taking the name and character of his benefactor.
Saviola, deceived by the name and resemblance, mistook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>him for Anglesea, and asked him to act as his second.
Stukely consented, and when Saviola fell, mortally
wounded, the dying man intrusted the impostor with important
papers and confidential messages, to be delivered
to you at Geneva. Now do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I see. But he took his time in coming to Geneva;
did not make his appearance there, indeed, until
weeks after Saviola’s death, when he came, I suppose,
in the course of his own business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, my dear Elfrida, it must have been the sight
of your beautiful face that tempted him to his subtle
villainies; to use the papers and the information he
really possessed in the manufacturing of false evidence,
to convince you that your true and lawful marriage had
been a fraud, in order to get you in his power.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes. But when and how did you discover that
the marriage was really lawful, and that the evidence
produced by Stukely was fabricated?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the appearance, yesterday, of the bona-fide Angus
Anglesea, who went with you and Saviola to Scotland,
saw you married, and, for your better security,
took an attested copy of your marriage certificate, which
I have now in my possession.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My brother’s friend here! My brother’s friend all
that we first believed him to be! The vow he made to
see me scathless through my mad marriage kept to the
letter! The shadow lifted from my life! Oh! I am so
glad—so glad, and so grateful! Thank Heaven!—oh,
thank Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not excite yourself, Elfrida. You promised to be
quiet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I will. I will be quiet. But I am so happy—happier
than I have been for twenty-five years! What
brought Gen. Anglesea here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He came in search of you. He brought with him
some papers that belong to you,” said the squire; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>then, while the lady listened with breathless interest, he
told her of his accidental meeting with her brother’s
old friend on the avenue the night before, and of the
long interview they had had in the apartments of the
general, in which the latter had told of his visit to
Naples, his chance encounter with the Prince Saviola,
and all that had transpired on the occasion, which was
followed a few weeks later by the death of the prince,
who had left all his devisable estate to his grandnephew,
Rolando, only son of Luigi Saviola, and his wife, Elfrida
Glennon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And our dear friend took all the trouble to go to
Geneva and hunt up the baptismal register of my son,
and then to come across the ocean to find me out?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And to bring you the copies of your marriage certificate,
the register of your son’s birth and baptism,
and of your greatuncle’s will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But my son, Abel!—my son!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our son’s release is the question of a few hours only.
He has been a voluntary prisoner because he has been
grossly deceived by Stukely into the belief that he is
Stukely’s son——”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lady gave a cry of horror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he refused to testify against his supposed father.
This morning, Grandiere, Anglesea and myself will go
to see him together and tell him the truth. He will no
longer refuse to testify. We will then go to the commissioner
of prisoners and ask for him an early hearing.
If there should be any delay, we will go to the President.
I think I can promise that he will be released
before sunset.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heaven grant it!” breathed the lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now, Elfrida, I must summon your nurse and
leave you to repose. You had better not try to see any
one else to-day, not even the children. Anglesea will
wait until to-morrow for an interview.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“One more word before you leave me, Abel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How came I back here in this bed? Where did you
find me? I know I was crazed with trouble when I left
that statement on the table and started on my journey.
I have no distinct memory of that journey until I lost
myself in a wild, dark, desert place, infested with wild
beasts and birds of prey, and then oblivion, until I
awoke to find myself in this bed. How did I get back?
Who brought me home?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have never been away, dear Elfrida. Your
‘howling wilderness’ was but a delirious dream. In
your distraction you prepared to leave me, no doubt,
but you never left the room. You were found by little
Elva, dressed as for a journey, but lying in a swoon
upon the carpet. You were put to bed and skilfully
treated, and you have got better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is—it—possible?” murmured the lady, passing her
hand dreamily over her forehead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is true. And now, dearest, though I would much
rather pass the whole day beside your bed, I must call
your nurse and let you rest. You must not be disturbed
again to-day,” said Abel Force, as he stooped and
kissed her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She put out her arms and drew his head down again
and returned his kiss, murmuring:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bless you, Abel! Bless you! Bless you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she released him, and he went softly to the door
and opened it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Winder, the sick nurse, was sitting on a chair a
few feet off. She arose and met the squire, saying, reproachfully:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have stayed too long, sir! The doctor expressly
said that no one must talk to my patient for more than
five minutes, and you have stayed half an hour, at least.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>It is very wrong, sir, indeed, very wrong—and I should
not like to be responsible for the consequences!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must pardon me on this occasion, nurse,” said
the squire, good-humoredly. “I hope I have done your
patient no harm, and I promise that no one else shall
disturb her to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir, that they shan’t! I will see to that!” answered
the woman, with the despotism of her class.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force was too happy to be resentful.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went downstairs to the ladies’ parlor, where he
found a large party waiting for him—Odalite, Elva,
Wynnette, Mrs. Hedge, Miss Grandiere, Miss Bayard,
Rosemary, Capt. Gideon and young Sam.</p>

<p class='c007'>He bowed as he entered the room, where he was
promptly met by Wynnette, who at once flew at him and
pecked him with the words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, you are a perfect outlaw. You were not given
permission to stay more than five minutes in mamma’s
room, and you have stayed—about five hours, it seems
to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! tut, tut, tut! What reckless exaggeration! Not
half an hour, my dear,” said the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And we are all just famishing. Here are our friends
from the country, too. They have got furnished apartments
on E Street, but they have to come here for their
meals, and they are just fainting with hunger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The squire thought they need not have waited for him,
but might have gone down to breakfast under the escort
of the old skipper, but he was too kind-hearted to say so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is only teasing you, Mr. Force. She has no
respect for the fourth commandment. We have but just
arrived, and though we have excellent appetites for our
breakfast, we are not suffering from hunger,” said Mrs.
Hedge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know, Wynnette,” said the chick-pecked papa.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“But now we will go downstairs at once. Where is
Enderby, then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He went out to breakfast with a friend who has just
arrived from England, but I didn’t catch his name,”
replied the skipper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I know. Miss Sibby, will you take my arm?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, what do I want with your arm, Abel Force?
Them as has arms and legs of their own, sez I, don’t
need to be toted along on other people’s, sez I,” replied
the old lady, trotting on before the party.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLV<br> <span class='c005'>WINDING UP</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When the party returned to the drawing room they
found the earl and the general waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The squire greeted his friends, and then introduced
the general.</p>

<p class='c007'>The visitors from the country, who had known the
counterfeit to their cost, were now very much pleased
to make the acquaintance of the genuine officer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently, taking Anglesea aside, Mr. Force said to
him:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have had a long interview this morning with my
invalid wife. There has been a full explanation between
us; but the excitement of such a conversation has exhausted
her, and nurse and doctor forbid any more talk
to-day, and enjoin absolute repose. To-morrow she will
see you. In the meantime, will you be so good, if you
have no objection, to go with Capt. Grandiere and myself
to one of our military prisons? You need not fear
anything unwholesome. The place is a miracle of cleanliness.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>“A veteran of the East Indian army need not fear
the sight of a military prison,” laughed the earl. “But
what may be the object of our visit?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force then explained the real position of Roland
Bayard and of Byrne Stukely, and the deception
that had been practiced by the slaver captain on his
young prisoner to persuade the latter that he was the
son of the former, and to prevent him from giving the
evidence that would clear himself and hang his supposed
father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is to abuse the young fellow of this false impression,
and to prove to him his real parentage, that I wish
you to accompany us to the prison, general,” concluded
Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, I will do all that with much pleasure. So
my estimable relative, Stukely, has wound up his career
by turning pirate and slaver in these war times! Well,
something of the sort might have been expected of him.
And his extradition has been demanded by the British
Government, I hear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These last words fell on the ear of Capt. Grandiere,
who immediately answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and when they get him they’ll hang him, for
they don’t mince matters with such scoundrels as we do!
But, Force,” he added, turning to the squire, “an article
in this morning’s paper, while it confirms the report
about Stukely, denies that the extradition of Craven
Cloud, or any other than the slaver captain, has been
demanded. And that is plausible, too, for what time
had they to hear of Craven Cloud, who has only passed
a few weeks on board of the slaver by which he was taken
prisoner?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And who is Craven Cloud?” demanded the general.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Craven Cloud is the name our poor Roland took in
his dire misery to save his own name from unmerited
dishonor and to save his friends from the knowledge of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>his possible fate. I am glad that he is not included in
this demand of your government.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So am I, for his extradition would have involved
painful delays in getting his rights.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force then rang the bell and ordered a carriage—if
one could be procured—to be at the door in twenty
minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he went up to Rosemary Hedge, took her hand,
and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear little, faithful heart, we are all going to get
Roland out of prison. It may take us all day, for there
may be lots of red tape to disentangle; but we expect
to bring him back with us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rosemary smiled gratefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did I hear you say you expected to bring my Roland
back with you?” inquired Miss Sibby.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, madam,” replied the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, now, you do it, Abel Force! You better had,
squire! If you don’t I’ll walk myself right up to the
President! I won’t go to any of your secretaries, nor
commissioners, nor any other understrappers! I’ll walk
myself right up to the President of these United States,
and I’ll demand of him why a brave and honorable
young man who is the adopted nephew of a descendant
of the great duke of England is kept in prison! If you
go to any one, sez I, go to headquarters, sez I!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What does she mean by the ‘duke of England’?” inquired
the general, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, she means a duke of England—that is, Thomas,
fourth Duke of Norfolk, one of whose younger sons came
over to Maryland with Leonard Calvert in 1633, and
from whom Miss Bayard’s mother was really descended—a
fact which she never forgets or allows any one else
to forget. A long decline, you will say, but, my dear
general, there are people descended from your English
aristocracy who are working on our roads, or pining in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>our prisons, as there are also people descended from your
English peasantry who are filling the highest places in
our social and national life. The waves of rank rise and
fall like those of the ocean!”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Here we go up—up—up!</div>
      <div class='line'>And here we go down—down—downy!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>murmured Wynnette, who, standing nearest the speakers,
had overheard with her sharp ears the low-toned
words of this conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The carriage was now announced, and the three gentlemen
left the room to go upon their visit to Roland,
in the Old Capitol prison, putting the ladies under the
care of Sam Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Sam, too gallant to leave them, yet with his
“ruling passion strong,” under all circumstances, proposed
to take them to the Agricultural College, and also
to the agricultural grounds and conservatories.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the ladies consented to go, except Odalite, who
decided to stay home for the chance of being admitted
to see her invalid mother, and of receiving a visit from
her lover, should his official duties give him time to call.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Le found no opportunity to visit his sweetheart
that day, and Odalite remained alone, unsummoned
even by her mother, who, jealously guarded by her nurse,
was kept in a state of complete quietude.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not go down to lunch because she disliked
to enter alone the public dining room, crowded as it
was at all times with officers, soldiers and civilians.</p>

<p class='c007'>She remained in the ladies’ parlor, ate a few crackers,
read a few newspapers, went occasionally to her mother’s
door to inquire after the patient, and hearing that she
was resting quietly, returned to her parlor and her reading.</p>

<p class='c007'>So passed the day.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>It was late in the afternoon when Sam Grandiere and
his party returned from their sightseeing excursion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ladies were hungry and fatigued, and anxious to
get something to eat, and then to go to their rooms and
lie down.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Sam was full of the wonders of agriculture, horticulture
and floriculture to which he had been introduced
that day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I was to be condemned for my sins to live in the
city—which Heaven in mercy forbid—and was allowed
to choose the place of my punishment, it would be the
Agricultural College. I could stand that better than
any other place,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>And this was high praise, coming from such a quarter.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they had all lunched the Grandieres and
Hedges returned to their lodgings in E Street to rest
before dinner. They always went and came under protest,
declaring that to sleep in one house and eat in another
seemed to them so disorderly as to border on indecency.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Wynnette always quoted Sancho Panza, reminding
them that “Travelers must be content,” especially
in war time.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was dark when at length the three gentlemen returned
to the hotel, with Lieut. Force and Roland Bayard
in their company.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they entered the parlor Odalite sprang up with a
little cry of joy, given no less to the released prisoner
than to her betrothed lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it all over? Is Roland quite free now?” she inquired,
after she had shaken hands with both the young
men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, no, not quite over, for Roland is detained here
in Washington as a witness. Perhaps he will have to go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>to England as a witness. Find seats, gentlemen. I will
tell you all about it, Odalite,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they were all seated, the squire continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We went from here to the Old Capitol prison, to see
this knight, who was going to sacrifice himself upon a
hallucination. Never mind that, you will understand
by and by. Our friend here was enabled to give Roland
the true history of his birth and parentage, being fully
acquainted with all the facts and furnished with documents
to prove them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And who, then, is he—Roland?” inquired Odalite,
with affectionate interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stay, my dear! Not now! I cannot inform you
just yet. You shall know his position presently. Now
I wish to tell you how we released Roland. First we
told his own story and convinced him that he owed no
duty to the impostor who had deceived him. Then we
went to the commissioner of prisoners, without much
success. Then to the secretary of war, without much
more. Finally to the President, who, after hearing
what we had to say, signed an order for Roland’s release
on parole.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why not release in full?” inquired the young
lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because, my dear, there must be an investigation.
And that takes time. However, he is practically free.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLVI<br> <span class='c005'>REVELATIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The ladies’ parlor of the Blank Hotel, in the city of
Washington, consisted of several rooms thrown into one
by arches, draped with curtains.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>It was the habit of the guests to collect in family or
social groups in the several compartments of this saloon,
where each circle could enjoy some privacy apart from
the stranger inmates.</p>

<p class='c007'>On this warm evening in May all the Forces, except
the mother, all the Grandieres who were in Washington,
the Hedges, Miss Bayard, Roland, Gen. Anglesea and
the Earl of Enderby, were assembled in the rear alcove,
at a safe distance from any other guests who might be
in the parlor.</p>

<p class='c007'>For still greater privacy the curtains of the arch had
been lowered, and for coolness the sashes of the bay
window at the back had been raised.</p>

<p class='c007'>They thus enjoyed something like the seclusion of a
domestic drawing room.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a gay group at the other extremity of the
saloon, and the sound but not the sense of their talk and
laughter sometimes reached our party in the rear alcove.</p>

<p class='c007'>But nothing that was spoken among the latter could
possibly reach the ears of the former.</p>

<p class='c007'>The alcove was in pleasant shade this summer evening.
Some one had asked leave of the others, and then
had lowered the gas, to decrease the heat, as well as to
subdue the light. The May moon, at its full, shone in
through the open bay window, and softly illumined the
interior, falling directly on the pale face of Abel Force,
who occupied a large easy chair in the midst of his
party, who were seated around him, waiting in eager attention
for his words.</p>

<p class='c007'>The squire of Mondreer began to speak in a somewhat
formal manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My friends,” he said, “I have asked you all to meet
me here that I may explain to you some family matter
that you have not hitherto understood, or rather, that
you have entirely misunderstood up to this day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The squire paused in some embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Miss Sibby took advantage of the momentary silence
to nudge Miss Susannah Grandiere and whisper:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knowed it. Everything as is hid, sez I, is sure to
come out, sez I; but it’s nothing ag’in Abel Force, whatever
it is, sez I. I’ll bet on the old squire every time,
sez I.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force went on:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have all taken—or seemed to take—much for
granted in our lives which was not true. Now did you
not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—not that I know of, Force. I don’t know of
any mistakes we any of us ever made about you,” exclaimed
old Capt. Grandiere, answering for all his neighbors.
“In what respect have we done you wrong?” he
next inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In no respect have you done me wrong. You have
only taken some things for granted and made some harmless
mistakes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What mistakes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>These questions helped the embarrassed squire in his
awkward explanations. Perhaps he drew them out for
the purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For instance,” he replied, “you all took it for
granted, when I married in Europe, that I had married
a young lady who had never been married before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, of course,” replied the old skipper, while every
one else listened in silent expectation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You never imagined that I had married a young
widow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good Heaven! No!” exclaimed the old sailor, opening
his eyes to their widest extent. “None of us ever
could have dreamed of such a thing. So Mrs. Force
was a widow when you married her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; the widow of the late Prince Luigi Saviola, of
Naples.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“Goo-oo-ood gracious! And you never let on a word
about it to any of us!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was no occasion. The way did not open to
make such an announcement without apparent egotism,”
replied the squire, discreetly, but not very convincingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I confess I do not see where the egotism would have
been,” said Miss Susannah Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There may be a difference of opinion on that head,”
said Abel Force. “I could not go up and down the country
proclaiming aloud to all and sundry of my farmer
neighbors that I had married the widow of the late
Prince Luigi Saviola. Nor should I even mention the
fact here among my old friends this evening but that
new developments of circumstances have made it necessary
to do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Needs must when the devil drives,’ sez I. Not that
Abel Force has anything to do with the devil, sez I.
No, indeed. I bet on Abel Force every time, sez I,”
muttered Miss Sibby, aside to Mrs. Hedge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, squire, speak right up. Tell us all about it.
You look as if you couldn’t come to the point. You have
got something more to tell us besides that you married a
beautiful young widow. Out with it, squire. We are
all friends here,” heartily exclaimed old Gideon Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus backed up and encouraged, the embarrassed
and hesitating master of Mondreer took heart of grace,
and told the story of his wife’s first marriage. Not the
whole story, by a long deal! He suppressed much that
did not concern his neighbors to be told, and would not
have edified them to hear.</p>

<p class='c007'>For instance, he never hinted a word about the runaway
marriage of the fascinating Italian exile with the
too romantic young school girl. He merely told of the
marriage of Prince Luigi Saviola, of Naples, with the
Lady Elfrida Glennon, only daughter of the Earl of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Enderby. Of their travels over the Continent, and of
the birth of their only son at Geneva.</p>

<p class='c007'>He breathed no syllable of the fatal duel in which the
prince had fallen; but told them that he had died suddenly
while on a visit to Paris; and that soon after his
death his widow had returned to the protection of her
father, in whose company he—Abel Force—had first
met her in Switzerland; and that he had been so
charmed with her that he had won her affections, and
that he had married her some months later in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point of the story Abel Force paused for a
few moments, and then said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would be too long and tedious a tale to tell you
how we both became separated from our only son—that
is, my wife’s son by her first marriage, and my son by
adoption and by affection—the young man whom you
have known as Roland Bayard, but, who, in truth, is no
other than Rolando Saviola, the only son of the late
Prince Luigi Saviola and of the Lady Elfrida, his wife.
Enough that lately has come over from Europe this gentleman,
Gen. Anglesea, the long-time friend of my wife’s
family, who was present at her marriage with the prince;
who was present also at the death of the lately deceased,
aged Prince Antonio Saviola, and is the appointed executor
of his will. Gen. Anglesea has come to America
in search of the heir, and has found him in the person of
the young man whom, as I have said, you have known
so long as Roland Bayard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Mr. Force concluded his narrative a silence of
astonishment fell on the circle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now,” put in the earl, “I hope all our friends
understand the position of my nephew here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Capt. Grandiere started up and seized Roland’s
hand, and shook it heartily.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Rosemary slipped her slender fingers in those
of the earl, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>“Didn’t I tell you Roland was of patrician birth?
Didn’t I tell you he looked like you? I am not the least
surprised.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The earl caressed the little hand that was resting in
his, but made no reply in words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, for all that I knew it all along, and am not
surprised, I do feel as if I was hearing it all read out of
a romance, by the evening fire, in Aunt Sukey’s old
room in the farmhouse,” added Rosemary, dreamily.</p>

<p class='c007'>Le followed the example of Capt. Grandiere, went up
and shook Roland by the hand, whispering:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am heartily glad of your good fortune, old fellow—heartily
glad! Not that any fortune, good or ill,
could affect my friendship for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not likely,” smiled Roland. “If you did not
lose faith in me when I was in the role of the pirate
captain’s mate, surely no amount of adversity could turn
you against me. And as for prosperity, I know, Le,
that mine gives you unselfish joy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>All now in turn shook hands with Roland, and wished
him well.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man cordially responded to all this sympathetic
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force’s friends were not quite satisfied—all was
not cleared up to their contentment. They wished to
know how it happened that Roland had been separated
from his parents in his infancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the mystery, which has been revealed to the
reader, was never made clear to them, though subsequently
various reports got into circulation concerning
the lost child—the most popular of which, originating no
one knew how, was that Roland had been stolen by
gypsies. This romance came finally to be received as
the truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was late that night when the party separated and
retired to rest.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLVII<br> <span class='c005'>MOTHER AND SON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The recovery of Elfrida Force was very rapid.
When she awoke from sleep on the morning after her
interview with her husband, she felt so free from pain
and weariness, so refreshed in mind and body, that she
wished to get up and dress, and go down into the drawing
room to join her family circle. This the nurse dissuaded
her from doing, but advised her to put on a
wrapper, sit in an easy chair, and receive any friends
she might wish to see in her own room.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first one she asked for was her husband. Abel
Force came quickly, dismissed the attendant from the
room, and sat down beside her, holding her hand in his
own a few moments before either spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>The squire was the first to break the eloquent silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dearest, you will be glad to hear that our Roland
is at liberty; is fully exonerated.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven!” breathed the mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The morning’s papers give us the information that
Stukely will be yielded up to the British authorities and
will leave Washington to-day for New York, to sail on
the <em>Scotia</em>, on Saturday, for Liverpool.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven!” again breathed Elfrida Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have had an explanation with our friends and
neighbors; have told them all that they need know, and
nothing more,” continued the squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the first time since his entrance the lady looked
uneasy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not distress yourself, my dear. I will tell you all
that I said, and how I said it,” he added.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then he repeated, nearly word for word, all that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>had passed in the alcove of the ladies’ parlor on the preceding
night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Abel, how well you have managed to shield me,
unworthy that I am, from all reproach!” she murmured,
in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, dear! Do not speak so of yourself. If I have
tried to lift the burdens and dispel the shadows from
about you, it is because it would have been unjust for
you to suffer from them. And, Elfrida, I have had this
morning an exhaustive interview with our son.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, yes! yes! What will Roland think of my long
ignoring him?” sighed the mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He knows now all about it—the cruel, slanderous
deception practiced on you by the man Stukely, when he
made you believe that the marriage with Saviola was
illegal, and left you no other alternative than to do as
you did. And no shadow of implied blame is felt by
Roland—only reverential tenderness and compassion for
all that you have had to suffer for so many years from
the diabolical villainy of one man. Roland is impatient
to see you, my dear, as soon as you can admit him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My incomparable husband!” breathed the lady, penetrated
by her perception of his utter unselfishness and
superiority to every feeling of jealousy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! how you exaggerate, dear,” he said, with a
smile. Then:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you see Roland?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When you please,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>He arose, stooped and kissed her forehead, and left
the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few moments the door opened and Roland entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blood rushed to the lady’s face, and then left it
paler than before. She held out both hands to receive
him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“My son! Oh, my son! Can you forgive me?” she
wailed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Roland dropped on one knee and lifted her hands to
his lips, in silent reverence. Then he arose and folded
her in his arms, still in silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Speak to me, Roland,” she said at last, when he had
drawn a chair and seated himself at her side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear mother,” he said, very gently, “I have heard
your whole story from the lips of my stepfather—my
honored father, I should rather say, for truly he has
done a father’s part, and given a father’s love to me—and
I feel for him the deepest love, respect and compassion.
I wish from my soul that at my hands the demon
who has wronged you so bitterly could receive his punishment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no, my son. From your hands his punishment
would be sinful revenge. From the hands of the law
which has seized him it will be retributive justice. Roland,
how much, if anything, can you remember of your
infancy, before you were cast upon these shores?” she
suddenly inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not much very clearly, dear mother. But I do remember
a country place, where there were many cows
and some calves, fruit trees, flowers and a house covered
all over with flowering vines. I remember a rosy-cheeked
woman in a white cap and white apron, who
used to wash and dress me, and another little boy of
about my age, and give us our milk and bread in a room
that had a bright red brick floor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing more, Roland?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes. I remember something that used to make
a grand holiday for us, a great lady who used to come to
see us, and bring cakes and sugar plums and toys and
clothes. Then I remember being in a ship on the sea
for many days, but cannot recall how I got there, or how
I came away. These reminiscences I have often told to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Aunt Sibby, but neither she nor I could ever make out
by much study where that home of my infancy could
have been located, or what seas I had sailed over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And did no face, no voice here ever associate itself
with those earlier memories?” inquired the mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” replied the young man. “I was but four years
old when I last beheld the face of the beautiful woman
who visited me at intervals, and whom I had been taught
to call my aunt. But this last occasion was fixed in my
memory from the childish delight I found in the hobby-horse
she had brought down for me, and also by something
very opposite that—my distress at seeing her great
griefs and paroxysms of sobs and tears at leaving me.
These impressed the lady’s face and voice indelibly on
my memory, so that the image and the tone survived
everything else in my picture of the past. I was ten
years old when I first saw ‘Mrs. Force’ at our school
examination, but her face and her voice troubled me
with fancies that they had both once been familiar and
beloved. Mother! I remembered your presence in the
home of my infancy, though I remembered little else
about it; and I recalled your face and voice when I met
you again six years later on this other side of the world,
though I could not identify you with the angel of my
fancy. Yet I always loved you in both characters,
though I never ventured to show my affection; and I
somehow perceived your love for me, though you never
showed it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A veil was between us,” said Elfrida Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, a veil; but so thin that we saw each other
through it. Why, mother, dear, even our little Rosemary
perceived this, for she often told me that she believed
you loved her for my sake more than for her own.
To-day she told me that when she was in distress on my
account, it was only to you she could go for sympathy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And that was true,” murmured the lady.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“And, mother, dear, what treasures I have realized
in my new-found sisters. Odalite—always kind to me
because Leonidas loved me—Odalite has been most affectionate
to-day. Wynnette—charming Wynnette—has
been so openly fond of me as to rouse the jealousy
of Mr. Samuel Grandiere, who remonstrated in elegant
style this way: ‘Drot it all, Wynnette! You make
more of Roland than you ever did of me, though I am
to be your husband.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what did our Wynnette say to that?” inquired
Mrs. Force, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She answered: ‘Well? It is written that a man
shall forsake his father and his mother and cleave to his
wife; but it is nowhere written that a woman shall forsake
her darling brother to cleave to another fellow.’
And she hugged me tighter and kissed me closer than
before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And little Elva?” inquired the lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sweet Elva! Tender, loving Elva! She could not
ever have been sweeter, kinder, tenderer to me than she
has always been. Elva is the sweetest of all my sweet
sisters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is a dear child,” breathed the lady. Then, after
a little pause—“And Rosemary?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother, with your consent—and I am sure we shall
have your consent—Rosemary will be my wife. Dear,
true-hearted little mite! She would have given herself
to me even if I had been nothing more than a little skipper’s
mate, under the ban of suspected piracy! Her love
for me was so warm—her faith in me so true—I am
glad that I have the rank and wealth to offer her which
will make me acceptable to her relations. But, mother,
dear, Gen. Anglesea is waiting to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then go and bring him in; and, Roland, you need
not retire,” said the lady.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLVIII<br> <span class='c005'>THE MEETING OF OLD FRIENDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Angus Anglesea entered the room, ushered in by
Roland and followed by Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Force arose from her chair to meet her old
friend, who took her hand and bowed over it respectfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very glad to see you after so many years,” said
Mrs. Force, as Roland drew forward a chair for the
visitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish with all my heart and soul that our meeting
had been earlier! It would then have saved much misunderstanding
and suffering,” said Gen. Anglesea, with
a deep sigh, as he took his seat by her side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The past is past,” said the lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Every one in this world has something to bear. All
things considered, we have had but a small share of the
universal burden,” cheerfully remarked Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have brought some very important documents here
to place in your hands,” said Anglesea, beginning to sort
a parcel of papers that he held.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have taken much trouble to bring me these
documents. How can I thank you sufficiently?” murmured
the lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I need no thanks for doing my duty! This is
the will of the late Antonio Saviola, by which he leaves
all his possessions to his grandnephew, Rolando Saviola,”
said the general, laying the largest document on the
small stand in front of the lady’s chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>She bowed, and took it up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is the certificate of your marriage with Luigi
Saviola, and this a certificate of the baptism of your son.
These documents were necessary to establish your son’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>right to the inheritance of the Saviola estates,” he continued,
placing two other papers on the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>These also the lady took up, with a bow of thanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Force will tell you how all these came into nay
possession, if he has not already done so. And now, dear
lady, having surrendered my trust, I must take my leave
for the present. I have been cautioned by your physician,
who is waiting in the parlor below, not to make
my visit too long. I shall remain in Washington some
time, and I hope I shall be permitted to see you often,”
said Anglesea, as he arose to leave the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Must you go? Then return soon. Come often. Do
come and spend the evening with us. I am quite recovered,
I assure you, and shall join my family party in
the drawing room after dinner,” said the lady, detaining
the hand that he had given her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will do so with pleasure,” returned the general,
and with a low bow he relinquished her hand and left
the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>His exit was followed by the entrance of the doctor to
make his daily visit. He expressed much satisfaction on
finding his patient so much improved. And when Mrs.
Force spoke of her wish to join her family in the drawing
room, the doctor made no objection to the proposed
measure.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as he had gone, the lady dismissed her other
two visitors, Abel Force and Roland, telling them that
she meant to dress and go down into the parlor, where
they might rejoin her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two men left the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>A half hour later, Elfrida Force was seated in the
alcove at the rear of the saloon, surrounded by her daughters,
her young friends, and her old Maryland neighbors,
all of whom rejoiced over her as over one who, if not
risen from the dead, had at least passed safely through
a terrible crisis and risen from a most dangerous illness.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>All the gentlemen of their circle were absent, having
gone with Roland, who was to pass through some necessary
formalities before he could be released from bonds
and set entirely at liberty.</p>

<p class='c007'>So it turned out that the large party in the alcove
was a “hen convention.” And the subject they discussed
was a double wedding, when and where to come off.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leonidas had that day pleaded for an immediate marriage,
urging, with much reason, the long time that he
and his beloved had been obliged to wait, and the repeated
disappointments they had been fated to suffer.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Mr. Force had replied that he would consult
Mrs. Force on the subject and give him an answer as
soon as possible. Mr. Force had, in fact, resolved to
leave the matter to be determined by his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Roland had also pleaded for an early wedding, arguing
that he would be compelled to go to Italy to take
possession of his estates, and that after all that he and
his sweetheart had endured, they might really expect to
be made happy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Hedge and Miss Grandiere promised to take the
matter into consideration, and give him an answer in
due time.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now all the women and girls were freely discussing
the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>There should be a double wedding—that was a fixed
fact. Leonidas and Odalite, Roland and Rosemary
should be married at the same place and at the same
time—but in what place and at what time? In the
city of Washington, within a week, or in St. Mary’s
County, within a month?</p>

<p class='c007'>That was the question that occupied the ladies’ circle.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was so much to be said on both sides. It would
save time, trouble and expense to have the double wedding
come off in Washington. But, then, as Roland
and Rosemary were to sail for Europe immediately after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>their marriage, it seemed a pity that they should not
look once more upon old scenes and meet once more old
friends before their departure.</p>

<p class='c007'>You see the matter resolved itself at length into a
question of convenience or of sentiment. And, inasmuch
as it was a convention of women who sat upon this subject,
the decision may be anticipated, as given in the
favor of sentiment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weddings, therefore, were to be celebrated with
great pomp at All Faith Church, Mondreer and Oldfield,
in St. Mary’s County—that is to say, the double marriage
ceremony was settled to be performed at All Faith
Church, the wedding breakfast to be served for both
parties at Mondreer, and the evening reception to be
held at Oldfield.</p>

<p class='c007'>After which Leonidas and Odalite would depart to
spend their honeymoon at their own little estate of
Greenbushes, and Roland and Rosemary would leave for
New York en route for Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ladies had settled this quite to their satisfaction
before the gentlemen all returned with the good news
that all formalities had been duly observed, and now
Roland was a free man, without the smallest suspicion
of a blemish on his honor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now,” said Abel Force, “we may all go down
into Maryland as soon as we please, and show Enderby
and Anglesea what our country life is like, for they have
both promised to be our guests for a season.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will be delightful, and I am rejoiced to hear
it,” said Mrs. Force, very cordially. At which the two
invited guests bowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later on that evening, when Elfrida Force found herself
alone with her husband in their chamber, she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We cannot go down to Mondreer in less than a week.
I must write to-morrow to have the house prepared for
the reception of our visitors. And while that work is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>going on I must do some shopping here for the two girls.
You know they cannot be married without clothes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Without clothes! Good Lord, no!” exclaimed the
squire, and he gave in immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day Mrs. Force wrote to her housekeeper at
Mondreer, addressing that worthy woman as Mrs. Anglesea,
lest, with her true name on the envelope, the
missive might not reach her, or if it did, might offend
her; but—addressing her so for the last time, for after
announcing the advent of her family and visitors at
Mondreer, and instructing the housekeeper in regard to
the preparations to be made for their accommodation,
Mrs. Force wrote briefly of the facts which had come
to light concerning the impostor who had called himself
Col. Angus Anglesea, but who was really Byrne Stukely,
an ex-midshipman in the royal navy, long an adventurer,
and lately a pirate. She suppressed only one fact—the
existence of Stukely’s wife and family at Angleton—and
this she kept in mercy to the deceived woman, since
there could be no good come of revealing it. She ended
by advising the Californian to drop the name of Anglesea,
to which the man who had given it to her had no
sort of right, and to take back that of her late husband,
who had had every claim on her love and faith. She
counseled her to do this the more especially as the real
Angus Anglesea was to be one of their visitors at Mondreer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having dispatched this letter by the morning’s mail,
Mrs. Force ordered a carriage, and in company with
Mrs. Hedge, Odalite and Rosemary, drove out to purchase
wedding finery for the two brides-elect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two days later all the Grandieres, together with Mrs.
Hedge, Rosemary and Miss Sibby Bayard, left Washington
for St. Mary’s, partly on account of the expense
and inconvenience of sleeping in lodging houses and eating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>at hotel restaurants, and partly as an advance guard
to go before and prepare the way for the wedding parties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. and Mrs. Force, with their family and guests,
expected to follow in about ten days—or as soon as the
wedding outfit for the two brides could be completed,
for the lady had undertaken the supervision of that part
of the program.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Sam Grandiere had pleaded hard to be allowed
to marry Wynnette at the same time that Leonidas
was to marry Odalite, and Roland Rosemary. And
neither Mr. nor Mrs. Force raised any objection. But
Wynnette herself resisted the proposal in a characteristic
way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” she said, “we must not think of ‘marrying or
giving in marriage,’ while our countrymen are falling in
battle or dying in hospitals by thousands and tens of
thousands—many also perishing for want of help, and
not hands enough at leisure from business or from
pleasure to give it! No! I suppose it is necessary that
these others should marry for good reasons, but you and
I must wait for better times, Sam, because, as soon as
the double wedding is over and the two ‘happy’ pairs
gone, Elva and I intend to return to Washington and go
to work in the hospitals.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the hospitals! What can you two do?” had been
Sam’s amazed exclamation and incredulous question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We may not be first-rate nurses, but we can help the
nurses; we can obey orders, step lightly, speak softly,
fetch and carry, and do any work we are put to do, and
we mean to do it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And your father and mother mean to let you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course they do! That is what we all came home
from Europe for. And papa and mamma mean to offer
their services, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well! If it were not you and your parents, Wynnette,
I should say that you were all the biggest fools in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>the world, and that each one of you was the biggest fool
of all the rest!” exclaimed the provoked lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if it were not you, who couldn’t hit me back
because you are a man and I am a girl, I should box
your ears soundly for saying that, Mr. Samuel Grandiere!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I shouldn’t mind that,” said Sam, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the honest young pair parted good friends, Sam
going to escort his relations on their journey to St.
Mary’s.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLIX<br> <span class='c005'>A DOUBLE WEDDING AT ALL FAITH</span></h2>

<p class='c006'>“It’s a habit he gibs hisse’f, ole mist’ess! Nuffin’
’tall but a cussed, infunally habit he gibs hisse’f! And

Wot you reckon dey’ll do wid him, ole mist’ess?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such were the comments and such was the question of
Luce, after hearing the letter of Mrs. Force which the
housekeeper of Mondreer, with her usually perfect openness,
had read aloud to the colored cook.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wot yer reckon dey gwine to do wid dat ’funally
willyun, ole mist’ess?” again demanded Luce, seeing
that the other woman was studying the letter in silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’ll hang him! That’s what they’ll do with him.
He’s been sent to England—in chains, I hope—and
they’ll hang him! By all accounts they don’t fool with

<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>again! And if anybody else ever does call me so, I’ll

<p class='c007'>“All yight, ole mist’ess. I won’t call yer dat. But
wot mus’ I call yer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Call me Mrs. Wright. Wright is my right name,

<p class='c007'>“Jes’ so, ole mist’ess—I’ll ’membeh!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was my dear old man’s name, and I ought never

And now, Luce, you and me has got to stir our stumps
and make this house jamb, for there’s not only two weddings—and
Lord knows one wedding makes fuss enough
in a house!—but there’s a whole raft of foreign company
coming to stay.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I t’ought as dere was on’y two st’ange gemmen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, but one’s a lord and t’other a lion! And them
two’s as much as a regiment! So look alive, nigger, and
put your best foot first before the foreigners,” said the
housekeeper, with vim.</p>

<p class='c007'>While active preparations were in progress at Mondreer,
all the Grandieres, with Mrs. Hedge, little Rosemary
and Miss Sibby Bayard, returned to the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sensational news they brought from Washington
spread “like wildfire” through the county, and the capture
of the <em>Kitty</em> by the <em>Argente</em>; the taking of the <em>Argente</em>
by the <em>Eagle</em>; the detection of the true character of
the adventurer whom they had known and lionized as
Col. Angus Anglesea; the discovery of Roland Bayard’s
parentage; the approaching marriage of Leonidas with
Odalite, and of Roland with Rosemary—formed the
topics of conversation at all the tea tables and in all the
barrooms for many miles around.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>In the height of all this gossip, the Forces, with their
two foreign guests, returned to Mondreer.</p>

<p class='c007'>They immediately became the objects of daily, yes,
hourly calls. Every acquaintance of the family, high
and low, rich and poor, came to welcome them back to
Mondreer, and all were received with courtesy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Invitations were sent out “broadcast” for the double
wedding to be celebrated at All Faith Church on the
first of the ensuing June.</p>

<p class='c007'>When that day dawned at length the sun arose in a
sky as bright and blue and shone upon a world as green
and fresh as ever blessed the bridals of youth and beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>At a very early hour the church was filled with the
nearest friends of the wedding parties, while scores of
invited guests who could not press into the building for
want of space sat in their carriages that filled the grove.</p>

<p class='c007'>At ten o’clock the venerable clergyman appeared in
the chancel, robed in his white surplice, and attended by
his curate and clerk, and with their appearance a whisper
went around the congregation that the bridal procession
was approaching.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was true. A moment later the doors were noiselessly
thrown open, and the ushers entered, standing on
the right and on the left. Then the bride, Odalite, appeared
leaning on the arm of her father. Her dress on
this occasion was very plain and simple—a white silk,
trained, and a long, white tulle veil, with a very slender
wreath of orange buds, gloves, boots, handkerchiefs and
bouquet to match, but no jewelry. Behind her walked
her bridesmaids, Wynnette and Elva, girls even more
simply dressed in white than herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few steps in the rear came the second bridal train—little
Rosemary Hedge, led by her greatuncle, Capt.
Gideon Grandiere. She looked like a light, floating
cloud, with veil and dress all of snow-white tulle,
looped here and there with lilies of the valley. Behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>her walked her two bridesmaids, the little Elk girls, in
simple white organdie dresses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Last of all came Mrs. Force, with the Earl of Enderby
and other friends, and Mrs. Hedge, with Miss
Susannah Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Odalite was led up to the altar by her father,
Leonidas Force came out of the vestry, followed by his
groomsman, Sam Grandiere, and joined them. The
circle, immediately arranged itself before the altar—the
friends of the pair standing behind and on the right
and left.</p>

<p class='c007'>The venerable rector opened his book and the rites
commenced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Odalite was the palest bride that ever willingly gave
her hand to her chosen bridegroom; but, then, the
shadow of the past overclouded her spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leonidas perceived this, and pressed her hand in
silent sympathy and reassuring tenderness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rites went on to the end. The benediction was
given, and the bride and groom were warmly congratulated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the newly married pair, with their attendants,
withdrew to the rear to make way for the second wedding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Capt. Grandiere led his niece, Rosemary Hedge,
up to the altar, followed by her bridesmaids. There
they were met by Roland Saviola and his groomsman,
Ned Grandiere. They formed before the altar, their
friends and relatives standing behind and on either side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the rector advanced and opened his book, and
amid the deep silence commenced the solemn rites.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they were ended, and the blessing was bestowed,
the bride kissed, and the bridegroom shaken by the hand,
both the wedding parties withdrew to the vestry to register
the marriages.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this they made very slow progress out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>church, their way being impeded by their acquaintances,
who left the pews to offer their congratulations.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length they were permitted to enter their carriages
and take the road to Mondreer, where the marriage
breakfast was to be given.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a great success, of course. The guests remained
until two o’clock, when they departed, well
pleased, and leaving their entertainers to take a few
hours’ repose before repairing to Oldfield for the evening’s
ball.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the farm they all literally:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Danced all night till broad daylight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Then, after coffee, the two brides and grooms put on
their traveling dresses and took leave of their friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leonidas and Odalite went to Greenbushes to spend
their honeymoon quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Roland and Rosemary left for Washington, en route
for New York and Paris. Mrs. Hedge and Miss Grandiere
wept freely at parting with their darling, but were
consoled by the assurance from Roland that the trip
across the Atlantic was nothing at all in these days, and
that he should certainly bring Rosemary back to spend
Christmas with them, and afterward, if they pleased,
take both of them to Europe to spend a long time with
Rosemary and himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>To Miss Sibby Bayard, who had been a true mother
to the young man, and who was weeping silently and
wiping her eyes surreptitiously, as if she were ashamed
of her tears, Roland said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dearest Aunt Sibby, though I seem to be leaving
you finally, yet it is not so. You will see me much
oftener, and for much longer periods, than you used to
do when I was mate on a merchantman and away to sea
three years at a time. Besides, you will come and stay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>with us on the other side as often and as long as you
please—forever, if you will. We should like it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, honey! Never mind me! I’m not crying!
What should I cry for, when you are so happy? I love
you too true for that! Rale love, sez I, always rejoices
in the good of its objects, sez I! And them as snivels at
the happiness of their children, sez I, hasn’t much love,
but a deal of self in their souls, sez I!” Miss Sibby concluded,
with a glance of reproach on poor Mrs. Hedge
and Miss Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last they were gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the invited guests soon followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Oldfield was left to itself, except for the presence of
the Forces, who, being very tired, had accepted Mrs.
Grandiere’s pressing invitation to remain and rest for
the whole day. They all retired to their rooms to lie
down and sleep—all except the California widow, who,
with her instincts of order, volunteered to help to put the
farmhouse “to rights” after the party. She called to
her aid Luce, who had come to Oldfield in attendance on
her mistress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Luce’s eyes were red, and her nose was swollen
through much crying.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, come out of that, you fool!” exclaimed the
widow, who had finished with her own crying.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t help ob it!” sobbed Luce. “Dese yere boys
an’ gals is ’nough to break a body’s heart! Allers, eberlastin’
gettin’ married world without end! But wot’s
de use ob talkin’? It’s a habit dey gibs deirse’ves!
Nuffin’ ’tall but a habit dey gibs deirse’ves! An’ dey’ll
nebber be broke ob it—nebber!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, hush, Luce! Look up! Look up, woman!
There is a good omen! The sun is rising!”</p>
